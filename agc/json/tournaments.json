Help was given by the \r\nEnglish Golf Union to launch the event and to \r\nselect entrants. The Scottish, Irish, Welsh and \r\nCounty Unions and various eminent players \r\nwere approached for their support. All gave it \r\nwillingly and so was born the Lytham Trophy.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIt is held each year over the Bank Holiday \r\nWeekend at the beginning of May. It is now \r\nplayed solely at Royal Lytham with one round \r\nbeing played on the Friday and Saturday and \r\nthe final two rounds, for those that have made \r\nthe cut, on the Sunday. \r\n<br><br>\r\nEvery winner takes away a replica for the \r\nhandsome \"Sputnick\" trophy which was \r\ndonated by Members subscriptions. All have \r\nbeen international golfers of the highest \r\nquality \r\nand many have gone on to be successful \r\nProfessionals. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThe entry is now of the highest calibre from \r\nall \r\nparts of the UK and Eire and in recent years \r\nfrom all over Europe.",

In those days the \r\nBritish Golf Ball was 1.62 inches in diameter \r\nand the American Ball 1.68 inches. At that \r\ntime \r\nBill was an EGU Committee Member but he \r\nhad \r\na struggle trying to persuade his colleagues in \r\nthe corridors of power and so introduced a \r\ntournament to the UK where players could \r\nonly \r\nuse the larger ball as part of the conditions of \r\nentry; the rest as they say is history. The \r\nstarting line-up is limited to the top 132 \r\nentries \r\nby handicap and attracts players from around \r\nthe world.",

The \r\nSenior Division is for players 55 years of age and \r\nolder. The Open Division is for players under 55. A \r\nplayer 55 or older may play in the Open Division.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\nEach Division is made up of four flights based on \r\nTeam Index. Each flight is as follows. Championship \r\nflight = 4.9 and under, A-flight = 5.0 to 9.9, B-flight \r\n= 10.0 to 14.9, C-flight = 15.0 and above.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe format is a modified team match-play. Each \r\nflight of each team plays every hole in that day’s \r\nformat. Day 1 is a best-ball format, Day 2 is modified \r\nalternate shot, Day 3 is singles matches. Each hole is \r\nworth 2 points. Winning a hole is worth 2-points, a \r\nhalf is worth 1-point and a loss of a hole is worth 0-\r\npoints.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAt the end of each match each flight totals their \r\npoints. When all the flights have finished their \r\nmatches the total points from each flight are added \r\ntogether to form an overall total for the team that \r\nday. The team with the most overall total points after \r\nthe 3 days of competition wins the International \r\nKing’s Cup. In the event of a tie, the team currently \r\nholding the Cup retains the Cup.",
