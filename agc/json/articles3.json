    "teaser": "Despite a triple-bogey 7 in a playoff, the Golden, Colorado native clinched his third CGA mid-am title",
    "articleText": "Usually when you scribble a triple-bogey on your card in a playoff, your day is over, right?\r\n\r\nWell, not for Golden, Colorado’s Chris Thayer.\r\n\r\nThe 40-year-old and two-time champion of the Colorado Mid-Amateur Championship began the final round six shots back of the leaders on Sunday. Needing a near-perfect round, Thayer did just that as he carded a 6-under 66 to get himself to eight under par and snuck himself through the back door of a three-man playoff.\r\n\r\nThe trio made rather boring play of the first playoff on No. 18. Colorado State men’s assistant coach Parker Edens made his exit with a bogey, leaving the spotlight for Thayer and Josh McLaughlin.\r\n\r\nThis is where things get fun.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThayer took two penalty shots after one shot went left out of bounds and another was stuck in a tree. Somehow getting out of there with a triple-bogey seven, the pressure was somehow on McLaughlin. McLaughlin also took a penalty shot off the tee and had to hack through some native grass that would have made Winged Foot’s rough look like a walk in the park. Stepping up to his seventh shot, McLaughlin clutched up and knocked home the putt for a matching seven.\r\n\r\nHaving to squeeze in between public play groups, the two headed back to the 18th tee for what would become the final playoff hole.\r\n\r\nAs McLaughlin’s drive veered off into the native grass once again, Thayer was finally able to take advantage. Hitting his approach into a greenside bunker, Thayer escaped and his ball nestled onto a twice familiar line he had earlier in the day and playoff. Using his past experience, Thayer drained the 22-foot putt for his third Colorado Mid-Am Championship.\r\n\r\n“I don’t care that I made 7 and was obviously lucky that (McLaughlin) made a couple of mistakes too,” Thayer told the Colorado Golf Association. “That’s just how golf is sometimes. I’ll remember getting it up and down from 30 yards — one of my best pitch shots of the week. That’s all I’ll remember of that hole. Forget the rest.”\r\n\r\nWith the win, Thayer joins three others as to win the CGA Mid-Am Championship at least three times. It was also Thayer’s second win at River Valley Ranch (2014) that also ended in a three-player playoff.",

    "articleText": "Home is where the win is. That’s how the saying goes, right?\r\n\r\nUniversity of Illinois senior Varun Chopra and University of Arizona senior David Laskin were able to retain their overnight leads to snag wins at their home courses as part of the GCAA Amateur Series.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nIn Illinois, Chopra built upon his three-stroke lead that he achieved following 36-holes of play on Saturday. Starting his scoring with back to back birdies on Nos. 3 and 4, Chopra made the turn at two under on the day and 10 under for the championship.\r\n\r\nTwo groups ahead of Chopra was his Fighting Illini teammate, Giovanni Tadiotto. Tadiotto was attempting to make a back-nine surge following a 1-under 35 on the front. Carding a quintet of birdies on the final nine holes, including a trio on hole Nos. 13-15, Tadiotto ran out of holes as he finished four shots back of Chopra with a 9-under 207 total.\r\n\r\nWhile Tadiotto made his run, Chopra dropped in three birdies of his own. Following his final birdie on No. 18, Chopra secure the championship with a 13-under 203 total (67-69-67) at his home course.\r\n\r\nOut west, David Laskin was looking to do the same thing Chopra did just an hour or so prior.\r\n\r\nHolding a four shot lead as he walked to the first tee on Sunday, Laskin would only see that lead swell as the day went on. Laskin’s biggest challengers who were just four off to begin the day, all struggled to get anything going as the trio finished a total four over par on Sunday.\r\n\r\nWhile they fell to the wayside, Laskin found what others could not–birdies.\r\n\r\nMaking the turn at one under, Laskin turned on the afterburners with a back side 34 to finish the tournament at 12 under par, clearing the field by eight shots.\r\n\r\nLaskin’s Wildcat teammate Trevor Werblyo and San Jose State’s Parker Sisk took a split of second place at 4-under 212.\r\n\r\nLaskin’s final round 69 was one of just nine rounds on Sunday to break par.",

    "teaser": "Despite finishing with four straight bogeys, Pak posts a final round 74, finishes at T51 as only amateur to make the cut",
    "articleText": "As he walked out of the post-round scoring area on a sun-splashed Sunday at Winged Foot Golf Club, John Pak had a surprise waiting for him. On an oversized Cisco/Webex video board, Pak was greeted by several of his Florida State teammates who have been watching the 120th U.S. Open from afar. It was the perfect way to end a special week for the 21-year-old from Scotch Plains, N.J.\r\n\r\nLater on Sunday, Pak, a senior at FSU, will receive his medal for being the championship’s low amateur, joining an illustrious list that includes Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson. He also could be standing next to someone who, like Pak, would have been a college senior this year. Matthew Wolff, also 21, held a two-stroke lead going into the final round and was bidding to become the youngest U.S. Open champion in the post-World War II era.\r\n\r\nThat struck an inspiring chord with Pak, who competed against Wolff in junior, amateur and college tournaments.\r\n\r\n“It’s very exciting because it just shows me that I have a chance because I competed against him,” said Pak. “I know it must be a great feeling to be him, to be leading the U.S. Open. Yeah, I’m really happy for him.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nPak, a member of the victorious 2019 USA Walker Cup Team, started the week by playing a practice round with another past junior/amateur competitor, Joaquin Niemann, of Chile. On Sunday, his parents were allowed to watch him play the final round in person. His day included an eagle 2 on the par-4 sixth and a pair of birdies on the par-5 ninth and 12th holes. However, he closed with four consecutive bogeys for a 74 and an 18-over total of 298.\r\n\r\n“[My parents] have been my biggest supporters my whole life, so that was really special,” said Pak, who got into the field by being one of the top seven points leaders in the World Amateur Golf Ranking®. “They got to see me playing in some of the toughest conditions I’ve ever played.”\r\n\r\nWith golf in the Atlantic Coast Conference postponed this fall, this likely was Pak’s last competitive event until January. He believes the Seminoles have a chance to win the NCAA title next spring, and he hopes to play in the 2021 Walker Cup Match next May at Seminole Golf Club in Juno Beach, Fla.\r\n\r\n“That was one of the greatest experiences of my life,” said Pak of the 2019 Walker Cup at Royal Liverpool in Hoylake, England, where he went 3-0 (2-0 in singles) in the five-point win. “This week, I proved all my hard work is paying off and my game is at a point where I can compete against the best players in the world.”",

Valuck, who has regularly finished in the top 50 in the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-rankings/senior-men\">AmateurGolf.com Senior Rankings</a>, hasn't won a major senior event since picking up the title at the Society of Seniors Founders Cup in 2018.\r\n\r\nBut he consistently records top finishes, and today's win validates the trajectory his game is on.\r\n\r\nEntering the final round six shots behind Kerper -- who posted a tournament low 66 in the second round -- Valuck took charge with three straight bogeys on hole Nos. 11-13. A bogey on the 18th hole prevented Valuck from winning outright but his final round of 70 was still the best of the day by three shots.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nIn the Super Senior division, John Fritz of Mint Hill, SC also posted 1-over for the event, and passed second round leader Al Small, who finished runner-up.\r\n\r\nThe Savannah Quarters Senior Invitational was the second major event to be contested at the club this year; the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/9290/Savannah-Quarters-Invitational\">Savannah Quarters Invitational</a> drew a top drawer, mostly collegiate field when it was played in July.\r\n\r\nWhile the course saw heavy rains from Hurricane Sally, the agronomy team lead by Mr. Steven Hendrix put in substantial time and effort, resulting in excellent conditions despite the rain.",

    "articleText": "With a vast amount of college golfers being forced to take school competitions this semester off due to COVID-19, some are feeding their competitiveness with independent tournaments like the GCAA Amatuer Series.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThis weekend, two GCAA events are taking place simultaneously in Savoy, Illinois, and Marana, Arizona.\r\n\r\nIn Savoy, Illinois Fighting Illini senior Varun Chopra leads the mixed field of men and women at the University of Illinois’ home course. Taking care of business from the get-go, Chopra kicked off his 36-hole day with an eagle on the opening par-5 first.\r\n\r\nUsing the eagle to propel him to a 2-under 34 on the front nine, Chopra was able to kick in three birdies over his final six holes. Making the turn to his final 18 of the day, Chopra did not quite mirror the flashiness he displayed earlier in the day yet he found comfort in hole Nos. 13 and 17. Carding four birdies on those two holes alone, Chopra took 67-69 into the clubhouse for a three-stroke lead over his nearest competitor.\r\n\r\nOakland University’s Thomas Giroux sits in solo second with a 5-under 139 total. Behind Giroux is a four-way tie for third at 4-under 140. 15 golfers are at or better than par with 18 holes to go in Illinois.\r\n\r\nOut in the desert, University of Arizona senior David Laskin holds a four-shot lead with one round to play.\r\n\r\nUnlike his cross country peer, Laskin was sporadically consistent while building his lead over 36-holes.\r\n\r\nStarting on the par-4 10th, Laskin grabbed just two birdies on his opening nine. Making the quarter-turn at 2-under 34, Laskin grabbed three birdies before posting his first of three birdies of the day on his 17th hole (No. 8).\r\n\r\nWith an opening 4-under 68, Laskin kept things moving with a 3-under 33 as he wrapped up his 27th hole. Seven under par for the tournament, Laskin sank a pair of birds on Nos. 1 and 2 before coughing up a shot once again on No. 8. Able to negate the slip up with a birdie on No. 9 (hole 36), Laskin posted a 9-under 135, good for a four-stroke overnight lead.\r\n\r\nLaskin will be tasked with keeping San Jose State’s Kristopher Stiles, Parker Sisk, and fellow Wildcat Parker Werbylo at bay as they lurk in a three-way tie for second at five under par.\r\n\r\nBoth events will wrap up Sunday, giving all participants enough time to get back to their respective campuses to resume studies all while keeping their competitive golf game alive.",

Starting the day, Pak looked comfortable as he escaped the thick second cut on No. 1 to kick-off his day with a solid two-putt par. On the second, Pak rattled home a birdie on the statistically hardest hole on the course with a touchy downhill right to left 10-footer for birdie.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nFour under for the championship and one under on the day, Pak was once again hit with the Winged Foot welcome. Bogeys on Nos. 3, 4, 6, 7, and a double bogey on No. 8 were separated with a lone par on the fifth.\r\n\r\nOut with a 5-over 40, Pak seemed to have settled into a rhythm with a bogey on No. 10 that was negated with a birdie on the par 5 12th. Unable to stay consistent in a positive way, Pak rattled off four consecutive bogeys on hole Nos. 13-16.\r\n\r\nFinally disembarking the bogey train with a par on the par 4 17th, Pak finished his third round with a par on the 18th to card his tournament worst 9-over 79.\r\n\r\nAlready locking up low-amateur honors as the only amateur to make the cut, Pak will be playing for pride on Sunday as he looks to chip away at his current 14 over par score. As it stands, Pak is one shot clear of last place Abraham Ancer and sits in a tie for 60th place alongside Troy Merritt.\r\n\r\nTee times will be announced at the conclusion of play Saturday.",

    "teaser": "When the day began, six amateurs were inside the cut line. But only one of the 13 who started will be playing the weekend.",
    "articleText": "The golf gods (and the USGA) heard and answered our prayers. After a surprising day of low scoring on Thursday, the USGA adjusted the setup and made Winged Foot play like how many a Winged Foot U.S. Open has played – nearly impossible.\r\n\r\nWith the course playing harder, the 13 amateurs that were lucky enough to tee it up this week were almost completely wiped out of competition as the 120th U.S. Open heads into the weekend.\r\n\r\nHow hard was it for the ams? After averaging 73.5 on day one, the 13 shot a combined 96 over par on Friday, for a 77.4 average.\r\n\r\nFlorida State’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/19645/John-Pak\">John Pak</a> was seven shots worse than his opening 69. With a steady wind, ruthless rough, and harder pin locations, Pak’s 76 on Friday came without a single birdie.\r\n\r\nBattling the long grass all day, Pak found just four of the 14 fairways at ‘The Foot’. Relying on his flat stick, Pak averaged 1.72 putts per hole which was .03 better than the field average on Friday.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAs the day comes to a close, Pak is in a 16-way tie for 33th at 5 over par, one shot inside the cut line. He is ahead of some household names like Rickie Fowler, Jason Day, and Shane Lowry among others.\r\n\r\nBut it will be a lonesome walk for the next two days for Pak, who has already secured low amateur honors as the only amateur to make the cut.\r\n\r\nWhen the day started, there were several amateurs in good shape -- two were under par, one was even, and three more were +2 or better. But as Winged Foot toughened up, the free-fall started.\r\n\r\nArizona State’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/16374/Chun-An-Yu\">Chun An Yu</a> looked as though he was going to join Pak for the weekend and a two-man battle for the low-am honors. Just two over par for the tournament and the day, Yu headed to the par 3 13th.\r\n\r\nFrom there, it all went wrong for the Sun Devil. \r\n\r\nDouble, bogey, bogey, triple, bogey.\r\n\r\nOver a five-hole stretch, Yu went from four inside the cut line (+2) to four outside of it (+10). If anything from Yu’s career has told us anything, this will not be the last time we will see his name in the field at the U.S. Open; he has now played in three U.S. Opens in a row.\r\n\r\nOne of Thursday’s bright spots, Georgia’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18654/Davis-Thompson\">Davis Thompson</a> suffered a similar Winged Foot fate on Friday. Trying to continue the momentum he built following his one-under 69, Thompson instead went out in 40 on the back nine, lost five more shots shortly after the turn, and found himself three shots off the eventual cutline. He rebounded with an eagle-2 on the driveable par-4 6th, and came to the reachable par-5 9th needing birdie to make the cut.\r\n\r\nBut he couldn't get up and down from just short of the green.\r\n\r\nThe Bulldog was joined by Japan’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/17395/Takumi-Kanaya?p=1\">Takumi Kanaya</a> as the only amateurs to miss the cut by a single stroke. Kanaya shot rounds of 72-75 to finish at seven over.\r\n\r\nAfter a 1-over 71 on Thursday, 2019 U.S. Amateur Champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18629/Andy-Ogletree\">Andy Ogletree</a> (Georgia Tech) slumped to a 77 as he missed the cut alongside playing partner and defending U.S. Open champion Gary Woodland at eight over par.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nOnly two of the 13 amateurs improved their score from day one to day two. Both <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/15400/Cole-Hammer\">Cole Hammer</a> (Texas) and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/17054/Sandy-Scott?p=1\">Sandy Scott</a> (Scotland/Texas Tech) took low round of the day among the non-pros with 4-over 74s.\r\n\r\nScott closed out his front nine with a pair of birdies to go out in 1-over 36. But he still needed to play his second nine in even par to make the weekend, and despite a couple of birdies at the end of his round, he came home in 38. Scott carded a 75 and 74 for a nine-over total of 149, three shots off the cut line.\r\n\r\nHammer, in a similar position to his fellow Big 12-er, followed up his 77 with an all-around solid performance given his start at the par-3 10th. Short-siding himself in the front right bunker, Hammer slapped his bunker shot to 27 feet leaving a tricky downhill slider. Getting out with a double-bogey, Hammer settled down the rest of the way but will still miss the weekend with rounds of 77-74 and an 11-over 151 total.\r\n\r\nJohn Pak will begin his weekend at 11:18 am EDT alongside Adam Long.",

    "articleText": "Winged Foot was not what we were promised on Thursday. Carnage was expected, but not given. Scores from the 13 amateurs following 18 holes of play looked like the first two pages of the 2006 U.S. Open final round leaderboard.\r\n\r\nGeorgia’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18654/Davis-Thompson\">Davis Thompson</a> and Florida State’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/19645/John-Pak\">John Pak</a> lead the way following the first day of play for the amateurs. Mirroring each other with one-under-par 69s, the pair, who are both top five in the PGA Tour University rankings, are tied for 17th as the first round closed.\r\n\r\nThompson, the current No. 1 in the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-rankings/golfweek-agc-men\">Golfweek/AmateurGolf.com World Amateur Ranking</a>, took advantage of a three hole stretch on the front side of Winged Foot. Beginning the tournament with five consecutive pars, Thompson bid himself into the top five as the sun was still rising over New York. Tallying birdies on holes six, seven, and eight, he grabbed another on No. 11 to get to four under before dropping three shots over the final six holes.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe shot of the day among the pros goes to Patrick Reed and Will Zalatoris -- both had aces on their cards. As for the am’s, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18777/Eduard-Rousaud?p=1\">Eduard Rousaud</a> gets the nod.\r\n\r\nSettling his nerves, the Spaniard piped his drive 325 yards down the middle. With 130 yards to the pin, Rousaud fired a wedge just to the left of the middle-left pin location into the green at No. 1. Landing in the perfect spot, Rousaud added a little sauce to the shot as it spun back and fell into the hole for an eagle two.\r\n\r\nFollowing the near-perfect start, Rousaud nabbed two more birdies on the front side but not before carding three double bogeys to go out in 37 (2-over). Cutting down on the big numbers, Rousaud came in at four-over for a six-over 76. He sits in a tie for 122nd.\r\n\r\n2019 U.S. Amateur champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18629/Andy-Ogletree\">Andy Ogletree</a> (Georgia Tech), as is customary, played alongside defending U.S. Open champ Gary Woodland and reigning Champion Golfer of the Year Shane Lowry. The Yellowjacket won his group by three shots following a 1-over 71.\r\n\r\nWoodland carded a 74 and Lowry a 76.

    "articleText": "58-year-old Frank Vana was tied for the lead following the first round of the New England Senior Amateur hosted by the picturesque Mt. Washington Golf Club in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire.\r\n\r\nPosting a 69, Vana was a co-leader alongside three others who shared a one shot lead over the nearest competitors.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nA total of 10 golfers were at or below par when play began Wednesday, but just one would remain in red numbers at days end.\r\n\r\nVana, who calls Malborough Country Club home, got off to a sluggish start in the second and final round Wednesday afternoon. Retaining his three under score through the first eight holes of the round, Vana slipped with a devastating double-bogey six on the par 4 ninth. As he made the turn, he now trailed defending champion Bob Kearney who was two under par for the event through 27 holes.\r\n\r\nNot to be deterred by the mishap, Vana gained the dropped strokes back on with back to back birdies on Nos. 11 and 12. Back to where he began the day Vana tallied a par on the par 4 13th.\r\n\r\nMaking bogey on the 14th in round one, Vana could not gain retribution as he had done with his two other round one bogeys. Another double bogey plagued Vana’s scorecard.\r\n\r\nAs Vana fell off his pace, Kearney and fellow challenger Gary Shover were a combined three over par on the par 3 14th hole alone. Needing the field to stumble just as he had, Vana settled back into form as he knocked home four consecutive pars to close out the day with a two over 74, and the championship.\r\n\r\nShover, who began the day four shots off the leaders, carded one of just two rounds under par on Wednesday for a T-2 finish at 144. As for Kearney, his title defense fell just short with back to back rounds of even par (144).\r\n\r\nThe win is just one of many in Vana’s trophy case as he boasts a whopping 10 Massachusetts Mid-Am titles, an Ouimet Invitational win (2010), and a Round of 32 exit in the 2019 U.S. Senior Amateur.\r\n\r\nIn the super-senior flight, Dave Szewczul (145) bested Jack Kearney (146) by a single shot to take the trophy as the pair dueled all day following matching 71s on Tuesday.",

As the duo plodded their way around Columbia Country Club in Blythewood, South Carolina, the front side offered much more for the team than the closing nine.\r\n\r\nBell and Lutomski got off to a blazing hot start as they tallied four consecutive birdies to begin the final round. Grabbing two more birdies over their next five holes, the team was already one shot better than Saturday’s round.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nComing off a team win back in March at the SCGA Partners Championship, the pair of gamers smelled blood in the water, as they went in for the kill on the backside. With the course playing a touch over 6,700 yards, the long bombers picked apart the course en route to tallying 17 birdies and zero bogeys over the course of 36 holes.\r\n\r\nAlthough they held a slim margin over the field to begin the day, the team seemed comfortably in control of the championship as their lead swelled to five by days end.\r\n\r\n“We were in the final group,” Weston told AmateurGolf.com. “The guys we were playing with, they birdied the first three holes also. We were keeping ahead of them and I think they got deflated a little when we made the fourth one in a row.”\r\n\r\nFinishing the tournament at 17 under, the dynamic duo took the championship by five shots as three teams finished at 12 under par.\r\n\r\nWith Weston’s season coming to an end, he now turns his focus to heading to the West Coast to compete in the 2021 AmateurGolf.com Two-Man at Bandon Dunes. Instead of his good friend, Lutomski as his playing partner, Weston will be joined by his father as they look to make a run in Oregon.",

The duo finished on the second page of the leaderboard at the LPGA’s second major of the COVID-19 altered season.<br><br>\r\n\r\nZhang, who won the 2018 ANA Junior Inspiration, broke the amateur scoring record at the ANA Inspiration with a final round 72 which was capped off with a birdie on the par 5 18th. Overshooting the green, the 17-year-old high school senior had a touchy down grain putt from just off the green which ran out to nearly six feet past. With a testy comebacker for a birdie, Zhang knocked it home for a record-setting week to get the best of Ruffels for the second time in less than a month.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“Coming into this week I wasn’t as prepared as I normally would be,” Zhang said following her final round. “I had no real expectations.”<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nWith the even par final round, Zhang finished a shot away from a top-10 finish at eight under par for the week.

    "articleText": "Expect anything less?\r\n\r\nThe 35th Iowa Mid-Amateur at Sunnyside Country Club lived up to the hype this week. Several, up to a dozen at one time on Friday, had their chance to put their name on the trophy. In the end a four-time winner added his name for the fifth time – but he even admitted he didn’t expect that outcome.\r\n\r\nGene Elliott (pictured above), 58, who won the Iowa Mid-Amateur in 1998, 2000, 2009 and 2013, needed a low round on Friday in the final round. He got one.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nElliott, of West Des Moines, fired the Mid-Am Division co-low round of the day with 67 (-5) to win the championship by a shot over Ankeny’s Andrew Huseman, who just turned 25 earlier this year. Elliott’s round included five birdies against not a single bogey – a clean card.\r\n\r\n“I had a target score of 65, 66,” Elliott said. “I thought if I shot that today, I might have a chance. My round yesterday, 75, it was a tough day with the wind. I thought I was just a little too far back.”\r\n\r\nWindy it was on Thursday, no doubt, but Friday’s round still presented some challenges according to Elliott.\r\n\r\n“It was windy early on today,” Elliott said. “I putted well and got it up and down a couple times.”\r\n\r\nEven with five Iowa Mid-Amateur titles to his credit, Elliott was the first to admit he didn’t expect the outcome.\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t expecting this today,” Elliott said of his victory. “I can tell you that for sure. I knew I was close (to the lead today). I looked (at scores) after the 10th hole to see where I was. It was a logjam. There was a dozen guys who could win. I knew if I could make that putt (on #17), I had a chance.”\r\n\r\nHis putt, set up by a terrific tee shot on the 17th hole, was one of his best, ever, Elliott commented. When the dust had settled, it was a putt he needed.\r\n\r\n“I tell you what, that putt is one of the best putts I have hit in my entire life,” Elliott said. “That putt was on such a good line. I couldn’t believe how good that putt looked the whole way. A lot of times you hit a putt like that and it doesn’t go in, but this one went right in the middle.”\r\n\r\nA trio of players finished the championship at 144 (E), two shots behind Elliott. They included Ankey’s Connor Peck and Jon Olson, who both have had stellar 2020 campaigns, along with newly-minted mid-amateur Kacie Broeg, of Burlington.\r\n\r\nIn the Senior Division, Des Moines’ Tony Newkirk found a little something the final round as well, posting a 65 (-7) to win by three over West Des Moines’ Bob Brooks and Ankeny’s Curtis Holck. Newkirk’s round included six birdies, an eagle and only one bogey.\r\n\r\nIn the Super Senior Division, Marshalltown’s Pat Ryan cruised to the victory by six shots, shooting 69 (-3) in the final round to outdistance runner-up Jim Butler. Butler turned a nice round himself on Friday, posting 68 (-4).",

    "articleText": "Collegiate golf teams are known for the close bond between their players. \r\n\r\nAt the University of Kentucky, members of the golf team saw their inner circle rocked last month by the passing of Cullan Brown after a battle with cancer. None of them felt it more than his roommate, Alex Goff. But today at Lexington Country Club, Goff was able to celebrate again, winning the Kentucky Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\nThe moment wasn't lost on the champion, who opened the final round with birdies on the first two holes and never looked back.\r\n\r\n“If I could say anything to (Cullan) right now, I would just tell him that I miss him,” Goff said. “I know he’s in a better place, probably shooting ducks or making the best meal he’s ever made, but we all miss him down here and I know I’ll see him again one day.\"\r\n\r\nGoff recorded a final round of 2-under 70 and a total score of 12-under 204. That was good for a four-stroke victory over 2016 champion Andy Roberts.\r\n\r\nGoff started the round three shots clear of Roberts. His lead quickly grew from three shots to five after the two early birdies, then grew to as many as seven strokes during the back nine. Despite two late bogeys, it was relatively clear sailing for the first-time champion.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the sun peeked out for the first time all day when Goff and his playing partners were putting out on the 17th green in a moment that seemed like a friendly tip of the cap from the heavens. \r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n\"This week gave me the confidence though that I can play and compete with the best,\" said Goff. \"We’re playing an all-SEC schedule this fall and our first tournament is in three or four weeks which I’m really looking forward to.\"\r\n\r\nGoff said the tournament had a \"major feel to it\" as he relished his first victory as a UK golfer.\r\n\r\n<b>NOTES & STATS (courtesy Kentucky Golf Association)</b>\r\n\r\nPlay was stopped and a minute of silence was observed this morning at 8:46 a.m., nineteen years to the date of the events of September 11th, 2001. Players, staff and officials paused to remember and pay tribute to those lost that day.\r\n\r\nThe low round of the day came from Denver Haddix with a score of 67 (-5). The round sent Haddix up the leaderboard into a final position of T14.\r\n\r\nIn other honors awarded on Friday, Hugo Archer was presented with the low junior award (T7), 2014 champion Tom Campbell was presented with the low senior award (T24), and Denver Haddix was presented with the award commemorating the low player from a public golf course (T9).\r\n\r\nThe easiest hole of the final round was the par-five 7th which played to a stroke-to-par average of -0.16, surrendering twenty birdies and an eagle from William Molen.\r\n\r\nThe hardest hole on Friday was the par-four 10th at +0.72. No birdies were made on it today and more than half the field made bogey or worse.",

Neither of his parents played golf; in fact his father, Ivor emigrated to Australia from communist Czechoslovakia in the 1960s. It was a neighbor who introduced Michel to golf. Growing up in Perth, he competed against the likes of 2016 U.S. Amateur champion Curtis Luck and 2013 U.S. Amateur runner-up Oliver Goss.

    "articleText": "What do you get when you put one of the most decorated amateur golfers in the history of California competitive golf on a course he knows like the back of his hand?\r\n\r\nA runaway victory.\r\n\r\nTim Hogarth won the Pasadena City Senior title by 11 strokes today, and that margin was all made in the final round.\r\n\r\nPlaying the 36-hole event over the two courses at Brookside Golf Club -- in the shadow of the Rose Bowl -- Hogarth started the day the final round tied with the relatively unheralded Jordan Fisher of Oakmont Country Club. (The Oakmont in nearby Glendale, not the more famous one in Pennsylvania).\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nBoth players shot rounds of 6-under 64 at the E.O. Nay course on Thursday, doing some serious scoring on the final holes. Hogarth finished his round eagle-birdie-birdie, while Fisher had a eagle-birdie-eagle run from holes 14-16. \r\n\r\nNeil Moore, playing his home course, kept the pair in sight with 68, and Iain Macdonald of Industry Hills fired 69. A pair of golfers at 70 included Dennis Martin and Craig Calkins, winner of last year's Morrison Cup at Pauma Valley. \r\n\r\nBut the E.O. Nay course measures just over 6,000 yards -- the final round is played at it's next door neighbor, named for C.W. Koiner and measuring over 7,000 yards.\r\n\r\nBy the time the first third of the final round had been completed, Hogarth's sprint to the finish was more than a tortoise and hare story. He birdied three of the first six holes, to take a four shot lead, as Fisher recoded three-straight bogeys on Nos. 2-5 and a birdie on No. 6 to keep Hogarth's lead reasonable. \r\n\r\nBut Hogarth showed no signs of letting up, making five birdies against two bogeys on the back nine for a 5-under 67 as Fisher slid to a 78. Only one player in the field besides Hogarth -- Goran Hagegard of Annandale GC at 71 -- was able to post a red number on Friday. \r\n\r\nFor his part, Fisher was able to witness first hand the way Tim Hogarth picks his way around a difficult golf course, playing safe when needed, getting up-and-down when he needs to, and attacking the flag whenever possible. (And yes, he can putt.)\r\n\r\nFisher tied for second with Brookside's Neil Moore at even par 142, while Craig Calkins finished fourth at 143. A trio of players tied for fifth at 144 -- Mark C. Miller and Dennis Martin (both of Brookside) and Iain Macdonald of Industry Hills.\r\n\r\nPlayers managed to stay safe from not only Covid-19- but the poor air quality brought on by the wildfires that have ravaged California.

    "articleText": "Todd Hendley of Columbus, N.C. has captured his second Carolinas Senior Amateur Championship today with a 6-under-par, 210 total finish. With multiple factors pushing against him, including a swing change and a two-year battle with Lyme disease, he was able to push back and take the title after a 4-under, 68 on the day.\r\n\r\n“I have been working hard on my swing and it all just came together this week,” said Hendley. “I’ve also been struggling lately because of my Lyme disease. It has made my legs really tired so I have had to push myself to use my legs this week.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHe didn’t let anything get in his way and in fact, Hendley mentioned that his ball striking was his strength this week. He managed to hit all but one green in his final round. However, he struggled when it came to putting. The 2018 Carolinas Senior Champion said, “I hit the ball solid all day. I missed a bunch of birdie putts though, but it worked out that I made just enough.”\r\n\r\nWhile the birdie putts weren’t dropping, neither were bogeys. Hendley played a bogey-free front nine and after the turn, his putts finally started to fall.\r\n\r\n“I made a 10-footer for birdie on No. 10 and a real long eagle putt on No. 11 that turned it around,” said Hendley. Coming down the stretch, he bogeyed No. 15 and with a packed leaderboard he knew that he needed another birdie to stay on top. He quickly bounced back with a birdie on No. 16 and that sealed his big win.\r\n\r\n“This win means that all of the hard work I have been putting in on my swing is paying off,” he said. This is Hendley’s second Carolinas Senior Amateur Championship title including his 2018 win and his second CGA championship title overall.\r\n\r\nHarrison Rutter of Winston-Salem, N.C. claimed runner-up at 4-under-par, 212 total. Rutter had an impressive run at 3-under, 69 on the day jumping from eighth to second on the leaderboard.\r\n\r\nGary Robinson of Fayetteville, N.C. and Steve Liebler of Irmo, S.C. tied for third place with matching 3-under-par, 213 finishes. Reigning champion Steve Harwell of Mooresville, N.C. and two-time Carolinas Senior champion Paul Simson of Raleigh, N.C. tied for fifth at 2-under-par, 214 total.",

    "title": "Mass Mid-Am: Zelmati comes from 7 back, beats Parziale in playoff",
    "teaser": "Trailing the former U.S. Mid-Amateur champ, Zelmati chipped away and then hit the key shot on the third playoff hole",
    "articleText": "In one of the most incredible comebacks in the history of Mass Golf Championship events, Arthur Zelmati (Cranberry Valley GC) erased a seven-stroke deficit to win the 37th Massachusetts Mid-Amateur Championship on Thursday at GreatHorse.\r\n\r\nMaking his debut in the event, Zelmati shot a 4-under 68 in the final round before outlasting two-time champion Matt Parziale (Thorny Lea) in three holes of a sudden-death playoff. Zelmati pulled even with Parziale on the 17th hole, after the pair tied the 18th and first two playoff holes (18 and 1) he finally won the battle.\r\n\r\n<b>**See video the final two playoff holes below.</b>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nOn the 127-yard, par-3 15th, Zelmati hit a pitching wedge, and his tee shot almost rolled into the hole but settled two feet above the pin. Parziale, who shot a 3-over 75, two-putted for par, allowing Zelmati to tap in for the victory.\r\n\r\n“It’s more than I even hoped for,” said Zelmati, 32, of Boston, after capturing his first Mass Golf Championship victory. “I think it’s a great achievement after working so hard on my game and feeling like I was probably playing a little bit better in practice then getting nervous in tournaments.”\r\n\r\nIf the ball rolled a couple more inches, Arthur Zelmati would have pulled off perhaps the most epic finish to a playoff in any Mass Golf event.\r\n\r\nAfter making back-to-back pars on the first two playoff holes against Matt Parziale, he stepped up to the 15th tee for the third playoff hole. His shot was right on line, and it spun back perfectly for a near ace. Earlier this week, Zelmati said he was surprised just to be in contention, but that shot put him on the verge of a spectacular victory.\r\n\r\n“I thought it was going in,” Zelmati said. “It was like a dream, so you know I tried to get nervous over the putt, but it was only a foot so it was easy to make, and I’m happy that it was that close.”\r\n\r\nJust like his final hole, Zelmati completed flipped the script in the final round Thursday. Sitting at 2-under, he was paired with Matt Parziale, who shot 9-under through two days, and defending champion Nick Maccario (Bradford CC), who was 4-under total. \r\n\r\n“I definitely felt like the underdog with Nick and Matt,” Zelmati said. “I think that helped me a little bit just you know only focus on my game.”\r\n\r\nThe mindset worked as Zelmati went 2-under on the front nine, picked up four strokes on Parziale and pulled even with Maccario. Zelmati kept the pressure on with a birdie on the 11th and moving within a stroke after Parziale three-putted for bogey on the 13th.\r\n\r\nZelmati and Parziale finally separated from Maccario on the 14th, when Maccario’s second shot settled left on the cart path, and he went on to three-putt for bogey. The other two made birdie, setting up an epic showdown the rest of the way.\r\n\r\nParziale almost fell back to second place on the 16th but pulled off an incredible par save. His first shot landed on the lip of the left bunker on the edge of the fescue, and he popped his second into the air but rolled it into another bunker. After hitting out to the far edge of the green, he sank the 20-foot putt, while Zelmati also made par.\r\n\r\nZelmati finally caught Parziale with a birdie on the 17th, but it appeared all for naught after Zelmati’s tee shot landed far right into the rough, forcing him to punch out to about 100 yards ahead of the hole. Parziale hit the middle of the fairway and then hit a draw with his onto the left ridge of the green. Zelmati’s approach hit the green but was way short of the pin, giving Parziale the chance to two-putt for the win. However, Parziale left his first putt short and then pushed his 6-footer to win wide right. Zelmati then forced the playoff by making a 3-footer for bogey.\r\n\r\n“He played a great round today,” Parziale said of Zelmati. “I thought it was a little tougher conditions today. The tees were back a little bit. He was bogey-free until 18, so other than that, he played really well.”\r\n\r\nAfter signing their cards, Zelmati and Parziale went back to the 18th for the first playoff hole and tied again with two-putt pars.\r\n\r\nZelmati hit his tee shot on the 1st hole to the right and onto the parallel 10th fairway. Parziale reached the front of the green in two, but Zelmati chunked his second shot, which landed on the 10th green about 50 yards from the pin. Needing to take automatic relief and drop within one club length, not nearer the hole than the nearest point of relief, Zelmati decided to drop on the first cut of rough just outside the 10th green. He then hit a perfectly-placed shot over the green slope that bounced on the edge of the front edge of the green and rolled within three feet.\r\n\r\n“I just wanted to make really solid contact and hit the ball hard,” said Zelmati, who then tapped in for par to force another playoff. “I needed to land on the upslope so I just gave it my best and crossed my fingers.”\r\n\r\nDespite relinquishing his lead, Parziale said he played his best stretch on the playoff holes. But overall he said his putting just wasn’t up to the same level it was when he shot 67-68 for the first two days.\r\n\r\n“There were some good putts and some bad ones,” he said. “I just wish the bad ones could have been just a little bit better, maybe made one or two more.”\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">2nd Playoff Hole for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MassMidAm?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MassMidAm</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Vym4mPz4b8\">https://t.co/Vym4mPz4b8</a></p>— Mass Golf (@PlayMassGolf) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PlayMassGolf/status/1304116843058270213?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 10, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\nZelmati’s seven-stroke comeback victory coincidentally happened on the birthday of the late Arnold Palmer. In 1960, Palmer staged the greatest comeback in U.S. Open history when he erased a seven-stroke deficit during the final round to win his only U.S. Open title. While Zelmati is a long way off from becoming a golf legend like Palmer, it’s always cool to pull off your first major victory, regardless of level, in a similar fashion to “The King”.\r\n\r\nWell before Thursday’s comeback, Zelmati’s path to this victory has been a wild ride. Born in France, he moved to the U.S. when he was 13 and lived in New York City with his mother. He had played golf occasionally as a young child, but never competed frequently. Still, he had one specific goal in mind: “I wanted to play college golf my whole life,” he said.\r\n\r\nZelmati attended William & Mary University, a Division I school in Williamsburg, Virginia, but said his options were limited. “I never got to try out or anything, so I had to play and practice on my own,” Zelmati said.\r\n\r\nHe practiced well enough where he was able to make a few U.S. Amateurs (2009 & 2013), but “I didn’t play well once I got there, because I don’t think I have the game for tough courses.”\r\n\r\nBut Zelmati kept practicing and eventually moved to Florida to take a shot at pro golf. He played in the 2016 New York State Open, but after seeing the chasm between his game and other pros, decided to regain his amateur status and focus on competing at a more sustainable level.\r\n\r\nSince then, Zelmati has moved to Boston with his wife and frequently plays George Wright Golf Course, where he won the club championship this year. Last year he qualified for the U.S. Mid-Amateur for the first time, and earlier this year made the match-play portion of the Mass Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\n“I was kind of a late bloomer at every stage so for me now my 30s, competing at this level, I’m really happy,” he said.\r\n\r\nZelmati especially has his sights set on 2021 when the U.S. Mid-Amateur comes to Sankaty Head Golf Club on Nantucket. “I think I’ll feel confident and ready to play in it,” he said.",

    "articleText": "Looking to go back to back at the Golf Association of Pennsylvania Senior Amateur, Christopher Fieger was able to do just that at Old York Country Club thanks to a final round two under 69.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nSquaring off with his former Temple University teammate Paul Rogowicz, the two were able to take a one/two finish. With the win, Fieger becomes the first player since the GAP Senior Am trophy namesake Allan Sussel did so in 1985-86.\r\n\r\n“That’s good company,” the 57-year-old Denver, Pa. native told the GAP. “My brother Gene was very good friends with Allan. I know that Allan gave me a set of his Wilson Tour Blades when I was in college. I think I caddied for him a time or two, but I never had a chance to play golf with him. That’s my recollection [of Allan Sussel]. It was almost 40 years ago.”\r\n\r\nFieger also becomes the fourth player to win both the Pennsylvania Golf Association Senior Amateur Championship and the GAP Senior Amateur Championship in the same year.\r\n\r\nTaking a one stroke lead over Rogowicz, Fieger got off to a hot start to further lengthen his lead. Growing his lead to three strokes following the par 4 11th, Fieger’s roll was slowed a bit as the pair came down the stretch.\r\n\r\nThree-putting the 146-yard par 3 14th, Fieger got back to the basics quickly, logging a two put on the 17th. On the closing hole, Fieger crushed his drive on the 387-yard par 4, leaving just 99 yards to the hole.\r\n\r\n“I hit all 18 greens, and yesterday I hit 16 greens,” Fieger said. “So, 34 out of 36 greens was my plan. And if I didn’t pull out wrong clubs, then I would’ve hit 18 greens yesterday too. That’s my strength. I drive it fairly straight. I hit greens.”\r\n\r\nLeaving little to no doubt in his mind, Fieger knocked his 54-degree wedge to just nine feet en route to the three stroke championship win.\r\n\r\n",

Professional majors rescheduled, USGA championships cut from 14 to 4, tournament dates shuffled, many events cancelled.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the golf world, there was hope early in the pandemic that things might return to normal once the summer hit and many of amateur golf's biggest events might go off as scheduled. And while national events like the U.S. Amateur and U.S. Women's Amateur were conducted quite successfully by the USGA (albeit without national qualifying), many tournament directors found it impractical to conduct their events and were forced to cancel.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe game of golf certainly wasn't the issue -- golf proved early on that it was a sport that could be played safely during a pandemic.

Williams Invitational</a> at Oak Hill in Rochester, New York. Coming off of a course renovation in 2019, the popular four-ball \"major\" was preparing for a big return in 2020. But when the number of states falling under the state's COVID-19 quarantine order (requiring people traveling from those states to quarantine for 14 days upon entry) topped 30, the committee was forced to cancel.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/TheMajorsOfAmateurGolf/fourball\">The Majors of Four-Ball Golf</a><br><br>\r\n\r\nAnother major four-ball, the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/3365/Anderson-Memorial-Four-Ball\">Anderson Memorial</a> at Winged Foot, fell prey to COVID in a different way. Originally scheduled for June, the event was rescheduled to late September as the club prepared to host the U.S. Open. But with the Open getting pushed back to September itself, and COVID-19 still affecting travel into the state, the Anderson was cancelled.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00064098.jpg\"><br>The Mayfield Sand Ridge Club</div><br>\r\n\r\nBut while some have seen their championships derailed in 2020, others are thriving. One of the unexpected implications of the pandemic is the increased participation in the game of golf (as well as an all-time record for equipment sales which was set in July), as well as in competitive golf, perhaps as people vacation less and compete more. As a result, some tournaments are seeing their fields fill quickly with lengthy waiting lists.<br><br>\r\n\r\nA case study of this is <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/7653/The-Egg-Invitational\">The Egg Invitational</a>, played at The Mayfield Sand Ridge Club in Chardon, Ohio. Garrett Korte, the head professional at the host club, reports that the club was taken aback by the speed at which the field filled this year.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"We speculate that it is due to the overall increased golf traffic derived from COVID-19 related policies and changes,\" said Korte.<br><br>\r\n\r\nPart of this is the less restrictive travel restrictions in the state of Ohio (only four mostly-rural states are on their quarantine list), and part is simply the pent-up demand to play and compete.<br><br>\r\n\r\n36 two-man teams (representing some three dozen clubs) will tee it up at Mayfield Sand Ridge for the 7th annual event, compared to 24 teams in 2019. A seventh different champion is guaranteed as the 2019 champions Nick Fiori & Connor Pratt are not in the field. But the 2018 champs Jim Krivanek & Brian Smith will be going for their second title in three years.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAnother dynamic of the fuller, deeper fields is better scoring, and the tournament record of 199 set by Krivanek and Smith may well be in jeopardy if the weather cooperates.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Egg was already widely known for <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/23623/5-Tournaments-with-Weird-Names--That-You-Should-Play-\">its name</a> and for <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/23681/The-Best-Tournament-Logos-in-Amateur-Golf\">its logo</a>, but in 2020 it should also be known as a prime example of a tournament that has seen its fortunes rise as others have fallen.",

    "articleText": "Today, the USGA announced a major initiative that includes major tournament commitments, a moving their Golf Museum and two other departments to Pinehurst, North Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe move is bolstered by upwards of $43 million in incentives from North Carolina government and the Pinehurst Resort, which is donating the land. It comes with the commitment to add at least 50 jobs, and hold a major men's championship in Pinehurst at least once every 5-7 years. That equates to The U.S. Open being played at No. 2 five times between 2024 and 2047.\r\n\r\nGiven the USGA's -- as well as players and fans -- love of the Donald Ross-designed Pinehurst No. 2, the news will likely be met with great enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nPinehurst No. 2 is the only course to have hosted all five of the USGA's most important events: U.S. Open (1999, 2005, 2014), U.S. Women's Open (2014), U.S. Amateur (1962, 2008, 2019), U.S. Women's Amateur (1989) and U.S. Senior Open (1994).\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe 2024 U.S. Men's Open is already scheduled to be played there, and the 2022 U.S. Women’s Open is scheduled for Pine Needles in the adjacent town of Southern Pines.\r\n\r\nIn addition to relocating the USGA Museum and Arnold Palmer Center for Golf History from New Jersey to Pinehurst, the USGA will move their ball testing and agronomy departments to the location that USGA President Mike Davis referred to as the \"Home of American Golf.\"\r\n\r\nThe moves were confirmed Tuesday evening at a Village of Pinehurst town council hearing -- they also said they will spend $25 million on their campus, fitting it into the existing community. Construction is expected to begin in 2022. \r\n\r\nAccording to the Winston-Salem Journal, \"the move is expected to produce $800 million in economic benefit over 10 years and create more than 50 jobs for the Pinehurst/Southern Pines area. According to the bill, the average salary could be $80,000 for at least 35 of those jobs.\"\r\n\r\n“The USGA’s North Carolina history in golf is legendary, from Arnold Palmer to Webb Simpson, and we welcome this new chapter in golf history with the USGA’s new hub in Pinehurst,” said Governor Roy Cooper. “We welcome the USGA’s selection of our state for this significant new component of its operations and new jobs, and look forward to growing with the game across North Carolina.”\r\n\r\nIt won't be the first time that a museum has been located in Pinehurst. From 1971 to the 1990s the World Golf Hall of Fame called Pinehurst home, but attendance drops and a down period for the resort caused the organization to move to Florida.'\r\n\r\nThe USGA Museum, first built in 1919, is a 16,000 square foot tribute to the long history of golf and USGA championships, and their storied winners. Rooms celebrating the careers of Jack Nicklaus and Mickey Wright are flanked by artifacts like Bobby Jones' \"Calamity Jane II\" and Ben Hogan's famous 1-iron from the U.S. Open at Merion.",

Alternating birdies and pars over the final eight holes, Viboch came home in three under for a four-under 68, but ultimately finished one shot short along with Hathcoat at 13 under par.\r\n\r\nIn Sunday's second round, Tilly's bogey on the par-3 14th led to four in a row. On Monday, he again bogeyed the 14th but this time he didn't waver, rebounding with two pars and a birdie at the par-5 17th to give himself a one shot cushion heading to the par-5 18th. With Viboch in the clubhouse and Hathcoat unable to birdie the par-5 finisher, a par gave the Cal Golden Bear the championship.\r\n\r\nNicholas Infanti (Clarksburg, Md.) closed with a 67 to finish 12 under, two shots back in fourth. Ethan Farnam (66), Sam Harned (68) and Mason Greene (69) tied for fifth at 11-under 205.\r\n\r\nThe two-time defending champion, Devon Bling of Ridgecrest, Calif. and UCLA, shot a final-round 67 to finish tied for 18th at 7 under par.\r\n\r\nScoring was excellent throughout the three-day weekend, with 41 players finishing the tournament under par for 54 holes.",

    "articleText": "David Ford of Peachtree Corners, Georgia, stormed back in the final round of the 14th Junior PLAYERS Championship to capture his second AJGA Invitational of 2020.\r\n\r\nThe annual event showcases the best of the next generation of future college and professional stars. To date, 34 past players have graduated to play in the PGA TOUR's THE PLAYERS Championship. Representatives from eight foreign countries and 21 U.S. states (seven from Florida) competed in one of the AJGA’s annual top boys fields at TPC Sawgrass, which featured eight of the top 10 in the Rolex AJGA Rankings.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe 2020 Junior PLAYERS Championship field was highlighted by 22 Rolex Junior All-Americans and 49 AJGA champions, including 18 players with 2020 wins. Of the 78 boys competing, 45 players were signed or verbally committed to play college golf. Twenty-five players have previous Junior PLAYERS Championship experience.\r\n\r\nFord started the final round seven strokes off the lead at 1-over-par 145, but quickly got back into red figures with birdies on his first two holes on THE PLAYERS Stadium Course. The University of North Carolina verbal commit added six pars to make the turn bogey-free and 3-under-par 33.\r\n\r\nFord stormed to the top of the leaderboard with birdies on Nos. 10-12. He made his first bogey on the par-4 No. 15, but immediately got it back with a birdie on the par 5 No. 16.\r\n\r\nThe 2019 Rolex Junior All-American made par on Nos. 17 and 18 to post the lowest round of the day at 6-under-par 66. Ford won the tournament at 5-under-par 211.\r\n\r\nThe win was Ford's fourth AJGA victory, and second major win after claiming the AJGA Invitational at Sedgefield in June, hosted on another PGA TOUR course which hosts the Wyndham Championship. Ford has yet to finish outside of the top 10 in four national junior golf tournaments this year. The 2021 grad entered The Junior PLAYERS Championship No. 3 in the Rolex AJGA Rankings.\r\n\r\n\"It’s cool that THE PLAYERS Championship is here and there’s so many who’ve gone from Junior PLAYERS to THE PLAYERS, but I’m really trying to take everything one step at a time,\" said Ford. \"Pro golf I hope is in the future, college golf is soon, but for now it’s junior golf. I’m trying to focus on how I can set records there, and not set limits anywhere else.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Morrison of Dallas; Scotty Kennon of Bradenton, Florida; Kelly Chinn of Great Falls, Virginia, and Karl Vilips of Perth, Australia, finished tied for second at 3-under-par 213.\r\n\r\nMorrison had the second lowest round of the day at 4-under-par 68 and compiled his best career AJGA finish. His round included eagles on the par-5 No. 9 and the par-4 No. 12. The University of Texas at Austin verbal commit entered the week No. 38 in the Rolex AJGA Rankings and won the Southern Junior Championship in August.\r\n\r\nKennon, who is No. 69 in the Rolex AJGA Rankings, went the first 17 holes of the final round at or under par. He ultimately found the water on No. 18 and made bogey to finish at 1-under-par 71. The 2019 Rolex Junior All-American and ACE Grant recipient is verbally committed to Wake Forest, and owns two AJGA victories, including the AJGA Dana Incorporated Junior Open in July.\r\n\r\nChinn had an up-and-down final round that included four birdies and three bogeys for a 1-under-par 71. The Duke University verbal commit came to TPC Sawgrass as No. 1 in the Rolex AJGA Rankings. Chinn, a 2019 Rolex Junior All-American, won the 2019 Rolex Tournament of Champions to open the season and finished sixth at the AJGA Invitational at Sedgefield in June.\r\n\r\nVilips, competing in a record fifth Junior PLAYERS Championship, finished the final round at even-par 72 for his last junior golf tournament before he begins at Stanford later this month. The Australian won seven national junior golf tournaments, including three AJGA Invitationals and was a four-time Rolex Junior All-American.",

The warm weather loomed all weekend, but didn't slow down the impressive play with a leaderboard stacked with low numbers.\r\n\r\nThe 54-hole event visited the top facilities in the region with the first round hosted at Oak Valley Golf Club in Beaumont, the second round at Goose Creek Golf Club in Mira Loma and the final round at Victoria Club in Riverside.\r\n\r\nGreyson Leach of Rolling Hills Estates climbs back to win the Championship Flight in the IE Am Championship. Leach started the final round two shots back, but posted an impressive 8-under par 64 to chase down the leaders and win by one shot over second place finisher Chanachon Chokprajakchat of Anaheim. Leach posted rounds of 69 – 66 – 64 for a three day total of 199, 8-under par.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nMark Miller of West Covina carded rounds of  77 – 70 – 70 to win the Senior Flight by seven shots.

    "articleText": "The California State Fair completed play on Sunday with three champions crowned and the Men's Championship set up for an exciting final round.\r\n\r\nSix players were tied for the lead heading into Sunday’s second round at Haggin Oaks: Alister MacKenzie Course. The same cannot be said following Sunday’s round. None of the round one leaders matched their Saturday score.\r\n\r\nFollowing a first round 2-under 70, Blake Hathcoat (St. Mary’s) fired an 8-under 64 to take a one-shot lead over three players heading into Monday's final round. Out in 33, Hathcoat played his final nine holes at five under par, capping his round with an eagle three on the 18th.\r\n\r\nJackson Lake shot a 67 to move into a second-place tie at 9 under with first-round co-leaders Finigan Tilly and Brett Viboch.\r\n\r\nAnother 13 players within four shots of Hathcoat. With 18 holes remaining, the field was trimmed to 47 players following a 36 hole cut at two under par.\r\n\r\nPlay resumes at 7:00 am local time with 18 holes to play.\r\n\r\n<b>Women’s Division</b>\r\n\r\nCarding a 7-under 65 on Saturday, Tess Blair was able to separate herself by five strokes as the field went into the final round on Sunday.\r\n\r\nBlair, a sophomore at Sacramento State from South Jordan, Utah, won the Big Sky Player of the Year and Freshman of the Year awards in 2019-20.\r\n\r\nStarting her final round with a bogey, it looked as though Blair might allow the big lead play a factor. But she regained the dropped stroke immediately with a birdie on No. 2, and Blair was steady for much of the day, tallying nine consecutive pars.\r\n\r\nOn the par three 12th, Blair hit a bump in the road with a double bogey. Once again rallying, Blair circled three straight birdies on hole Nos. 14-16. Capping the round off with a bogey on No. 17 and a par on No. 18, Blair got back to seven under for the tournament, finishing off the event with a seven-shot victory and the only player under par.\r\n\r\nC. Sorensen shot the low final round, a 3-under 69, to move into solo second place at even par. Another three players were tied for third at 1 over par.\r\n\r\n<b>Senior Division</b>\r\n\r\nFollowing a first round 65, good for a two-shot lead, Chris Miller left room for error on Sunday. Posting a final-round 71, he went on to claim the State Fair Senior Championship at Mather GC.\r\n\r\nMiller got off to a slow start as he was two over through seven holes. Picking up one of the dropped shots on the par 4 eighth, he got back to red numbers on the day with back-to-back birdies on Nos. 12 and 13 for the second day in a row.\r\n\r\nParring out from No. 14 on, Miller carded a 37/34 split, two clear of his nearest competitor.\r\n\r\nThe defending (and three-time) champion Mark Morgan came up with his second 69 finishing two shots shy in second place. Joey Ferrari finished the event at five under par with rounds of 71-68 in a tie for third with David Bills who was just two shots off of Miller’s pace overnight.\r\n\r\n<b>Super Senior</b>\r\n\r\nCharles Richesin held the super senior lead following Saturday’s first round. Unable to build upon his opening one-under 71, Richesin made room on the leaderboard for a surge from the middle of the pack.\r\n\r\nEmerging from the group of four players who went under par on Sunday was Jeff Burda. Burda rebounded from his Saturday 74 with a four-under 68 to take the win. Tallying six birdies on the day, Burda was three shots better on both nines en route to his comeback victory.\r\n\r\nRon Johnson finished one shot back with rounds of 73-70 for a one under par finish. Richesin was joined by Michael Donnelly in a two-way tie for third.",

    "teaser": "Two Utah Utes made history while former champion Preston Summerhays opted out of a title defense",
    "articleText": "For the first time since 1981, an active Utah Utes golfer can claim the Utah State Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\nMitchell Schow, a senior for the Utes, battled his teammate Blake Tomlinson for the state amateur title at Jeremy Ranch Golf & Country Club in Park City, Utah.\r\n\r\nWith the Pac-12 either postponing fall sports to the spring or cancelling them for the season outright, the two Utes were able to make a run for the state championship over the past week.\r\n\r\nA unique situation, Schow would not have been as bummed about a loss on Saturday had it been to his teammate.\r\n\r\n“You never want a losing mindset,” Schow told Sean Walker of KSL.com. “But if I were to lose, I’d have been proud of Blake.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe match, at times, was almost as loose as a practice round. Tomlinson joked about the experience saying “When we were over our shots, we were absolutely serious and being pretty professional about it. But in between shots, him and I are the type of golfers where we can laugh a bit.”\r\n\r\nTomlinson, who grabbed a 2 up lead through the first four holes of the 36 hole match, lost his first hole of the day on No. 5. Holding a 1 up lead until No. 12, the momentum quickly changed in favour of Schow.\r\n\r\nWinning Nos. 12, 13,14, 15, and 16, Schow went from being 1 down to 4 up as the pair walked to the 17th tee. Taking another win on the 18th, Schow took a 5 up lead into the final 18.\r\n\r\nFamiliar with each other’s games as they have played over 500 rounds together over the course of their careers at the University of Utah, Tomlinson was able to pick and choose his spots to begin chipping away at Schow’s big lead.\r\n\r\nTrimming Schow’s lead to 2 up, Tomlinson won hole Nos. 20 and 21, Schow picked up a win on the 28th hole (No. 10) as the group made its way to the championship nine.\r\n\r\n“It was kind of hard to give each other crap, and be in that competitive mindset everyone wants to be in,” said Schow “But I like to stay loose, and I don’t take anything very serious. So it kind of helped me in that way.”\r\n\r\nSchow had to wait until the 31st hole (No. 13) to pick up a win to go 4 up with just five to play. Not going down quietly, Tomlinson took control of the 32nd hole to stay alive and cut the lead to 3 up. Able to pull out halves on the next two holes, Schow claimed victory on the par 5 16th, 3&2.\r\n\r\nThanks to Preston Summerhays opting out of a title defence to go play in an AJGA event (which he leads by one heading into Sunday’s final round), the two Utes were able to make history in an event dominated by BYU or a Summerhays.",

Gonzalez. Sam Harned, Youssef Guezzale, and Finigan Tilly all paraded through the course in a six-way tie for the lead with 36 holes remaining to decide a champion.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nMonas started on the right foot with six front-nine birdies. Cooling off until the par-4 15th for his seventh birdie on the day, he finally tripped himself up with his lone bogey of the day on the par-4 16th.\r\n\r\nThe 40-year-old Gonzalez comes into the tournament in good form, having won his second straight Sacramento County Championship at nearby Ancil Hoffman Golf Course. After starting his round with 12 straight pars, Gonzalez caught fire with five birdies on the final six holes.\r\n\r\nTilly, a senior at Cal-Berkeley, mixed 8 birdies with 3 bogeys. Watch out for him if he stays hot; earlier this year he won the Grapevine Amateur by 11 shots.\r\n\r\nThree golfers sit just one off the leaders at 4 under. The most popular score under par on Saturday was 3 under as nine players posted 69s. Two-time defending champion Devon Bling could not gain momentum like so many others in the field. Bling begins Sunday 5 shots off the lead after a Saturday 72.\r\n\r\nFollowing the conclusion of Sunday’s round, the cut will be made. At the time of publication, the current cut line is set at 1 over par as there are 61 players at or under par.\r\n\r\nThe second round is set to begin at 7:00 am local time.\r\n\r\n<b>STATE FAIR WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP</b>\r\n\r\nSacramento State sophomore Tess Blair leads the way for the women at Bartley Cavanaugh Golf Course. \r\n\r\nCarding a 7-under 65, Blair got off to a hot start with three birdies on the opening three holes at BCGC. The Big Sky Player of the Year and Freshman of the Year is keeping her game sharp despite the Big Sky Conference postponing all fall competitions to the spring of 2021.\r\n\r\nHolding a 5-shot lead over her nearest competition, Blair just needs to keep the ball in front of her on Sunday to claim the title. \r\n\r\n<b>STATE FAIR SENIOR AND SUPER SENIOR</b>\r\n\r\nAfter 18 holes, Chris Miller and Charles Richesin are in prime position to claim their first California State Fair titles.\r\n\r\n<ACG_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nMiller, holding a two-shot lead over David Bills, posted a bogey-free 65 at Mather Golf Course. Miller cruised through Mather out in 32, in with 33 for a bogey-free start.\r\n\r\nDavid Bills took a methodical approach after starting the day with an even-par front side. Tallying birdies on Nos. 10, 13, 15, 17, and 18, Bills built plenty of momentum towards Sunday’s final round.\r\n\r\nDefending (and three-time) champion Mark Morgan sits in solo third following a 3-under 69. Five players are tied for fourth place at 2 under and three at one under.\r\n\r\nIn the Super Senior division, Charles Richesin commands a three-shot lead over a trio of players at one over par.\r\n\r\nRichesin leads the final group off the No. 1 tee at 9:10 am local time.",

    "articleText": "Golf comes easier to some than it does for others.\r\n\r\nThat can be said for Raleigh, North Carolina’s Paul Simson. One-shot back of Evan Long to begin the final round, Simson was calm, cool, and collected throughout the day.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nOf course, Simson has been there before. 38 times before, to be exact. Over the years, Simson has etched his name into 38 Carolinas Golf Association trophies. Looking to make it three in a row for No. 39 at Kinston Country Club in Kinston, North Carolina, Simson had some work to do.\r\n\r\n“I started out as hot as a firecracker,” Simson told the CGA. “I was three-under through four holes. I had a two-shot lead and was thinking things were going to be pretty good. Then I didn’t make any more birdies.”\r\n\r\nFollowing a bogey on the par-4 6th, Simson went from a firecracker to an icicle. Following the 6th, Simson carded 11-consecutive pars. Meanwhile, Long had an eventful and colorful scorecard that netted him a 1-under final round, good for a 4-under total through No. 17.\r\n\r\nOne-shot ahead of Long on the 18th tee, Simson knew he had to make something happen as Long was coming off a birdie on No. 17. Striping his driver down the middle of the fairway, he trusted his 3-iron rescue to get him on the green in two for a possible eagle attempt.\r\n\r\nHe delivered.\r\n\r\nKnocking the hybrid to 12-feet, Simson had the advantage. Long, needing three shots to get onto the green, put his approach to just 5-feet for birdie. With the tournament coming down to a putting contest, Simson called game.\r\n\r\n“I took the putter right out of his hands by making that putt for eagle,” said Simson. “That was good because I think he probably would have made it if we had been going down the first hole.”\r\n\r\nWith the eagle, Simson tallied his first under-par score since the fourth hole and broke a streak of 11-straight pars. Finishing at 6-under, Simson looked on as Long tapped in his birdie to get to 4-under par, sealing the victory for Simson.\r\n\r\nIn the 70+ division, Jack Marin (Durham, NC) needed all of his first-round 67 to stay clear of a charging Charlie Parks (Asheboro, NC) who carded a final round 68 to finish one shot back of Marin. Marin posted an even-par 71 to finish at 4-under for the event, taking home the championship.",

    "teaser": "Mark Knecht is the first player in 16 years to accomplish the feat",
    "articleText": "The tip of the mountain in Kentucky senior golf is the property of Mark Knecht. On Tuesday, Knecht won the 21st Kentucky Senior Open at Frankfort Country Club with a resounding four-shot victory. Knecht finished the competition with a score of 136 (-8) to complete the “Kentucky Senior Slam” as champion of the year’s Senior Open and Senior Amateur, the first person to do it since 2004 when Gary Herfel completed the feat. The latter portion of the slam came two weeks ago when Knecht won at Danville Country Club.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nEntering the final round, Knecht shared the lead with Jim Volpenhein. It did not take long for the tournament to sway into Knecht’s hands, as he made two birdies in the first two holes while Volpenhein bogeyed the same holes for a quick four-shot swing. Knecht would make four birdies the rest of the round and was perfect in greens in regulation through 15 holes. His only mistake of the day was his tee shot on the 16th that went out of bounds which led to a double bogey, but his cushion was large enough where the hole’s impact was negligible. Tom Campbell would finish runner-up after shooting the low round of the day, a 67 (-5), while Volpenhein finished in third place two strokes behind Campbell.\r\n\r\n“I had no idea it had been so long since the last time someone won both the Senior Am and Senior Open in the same year,” Knecht said. “I’m thrilled to be able to pull it off. The ball-striking really helped with that; I struck it very well and I switched putters three weeks ago. It changed me from having some ‘really nice’ scores to ‘really great’ scores and that’s been a big difference in my game these last few weeks.”\r\n\r\nKnecht’s victory also assured him of the year’s low amateur honors. He’s the first amateur to win the championship outright since 2015. Bruce Oldendick is the low professional by virtue of a score of 143 (-1) which finished fourth place in the tournament. For the Super Senior Division, past overall champion of the event Craig RauvolaBouta came out on top by two strokes over Steve Rogers with a winning total of 141 (-3).",

    "articleText": "Three shots back to begin the final round, Rand Mendez of Wilmington, Delaware teed it up alongside leader Peter DeTemple (Lexington Park, MD)  and second-place Vance Welch (Laurel, MD).\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAfter nine holes of play, Mendez was the only one to make any ground up as he tallied birdies on Nos. 4, 6, and 9 to make the turn at 1-under par for the day and the tournament. Dropping shots on the front side was DeTemple as his front side was dirtied with a lone bogey on the par-4 5th, surrounded by four pars each way on the scorecard.\r\n\r\nWelch began the day at 2-under but also dropped a shot to fall back into a tie with Mendez as the two began to chase down DeTemple as the event came to a close.\r\n\r\nIn a deadlock for much of the back nine, no ground was to be given or had until the par-4 15th when DeTemple slipped up with a bogey. Dropping the shot, DeTemple fell a single shot from where he stood on the 1st tee to 2-under-par. Quickly getting back on the horse, DeTemple grabbed a birdie on the 16th to get back to 3-under as his playing partners were one and two shots back, respectively.\r\n\r\nWith pressure built up, the steam began to seep from the final group’s proverbial teapot.\r\n\r\nOn the par-4 17th, DeTemple stayed stagnant while Mendez tied him with a birdie and Welch essentially fell out of a possible three-way tie as the group made it to the 18th tee.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th, both DeTemple and Mendez parred, in anticipation of a playoff while Welch found the water on his approach shot in an attempt to tie the pair with a birdie of his own. Welch finished the tournament with a triple-bogey, good for a T-2 finish at 144 (2-over).\r\n\r\nOn the first playoff hole, both players found the middle of the fairway. Mendez was first to play and elected for a 9-iron from 128 yards out. Flirting with where Welch’s ball ended up at the end of regulation, Mendez was able to give himself a 21-foot, pin-high birdie opportunity.\r\n\r\nDeTemple answered with a dart just right and 9-feet deep, leaving a much better look at a three for himself.\r\n\r\nComing down to a putting contest, Mendez knocked in his attempt center-cup to put the tournament in the hands of DeTemple. Skirting the cup on the right side, DeTemple’s chance went out the window as the title was now Mendez’.\r\n\r\nAs for the pre-senior and super-senior flights, they definitely lacked the drama that the senior flight gave spectators.\r\n\r\nPre-senior (40-54) Rob Menefee tallied a 4-stroke victory with rounds of 73-69to claim the flight with an even-par 142. In the super-senior division (65+), Douglas Wood was cruising to a three-shot victory until a double-bogey cut his lead to just one. Luckily in golf, that is all you need to win by. He pulled off rounds of 73-72 for a 149, one shot clear of Jim Castagna.",

    "articleText": "Nabbing a win is always an emotional roller coaster. The ups and downs over the course of 18 holes can wreak havoc on a player’s psyche no matter how big or small their lead is. \r\n\r\nIn his first tournament since February, Jason Anthony had plenty of pressure as he stood on the 18th tee of the NCGA Valley Amateur at Schaffer’s Mill Club. Knowing he needed a birdie on the 605-yard par-5 closing hole, Anthony bombed his driver down the fairway, leaving 260-yards into the green.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nPulling 4-iron, Anthony knew where not to miss; right.

Citing adrenaline as to why he crushed his 4-iron pin-high, leaving a difficult 20-yard up-and-down Anthony was able to not only execute his third shot but almost call ‘game’.\r\n\r\nHaving to get over a bunker and stop his ball on a green running away from him into a greenside water hazard all while having the championship on the line, Anthony opted for a play that would have made Phil Mickelson smile had he seen the shot in person; a flop shot.\r\n\r\nFlying it perfectly, Anthony’s ball settled four feet from the hole for a near-gimmie birdie.\r\n\r\n“It was the best chip shot I’ve ever hit,” Anthony told AmateurGolf.com. “I can’t tell you how amazing it felt to get my first win as a dad with my little son there and my wife as well.”\r\n\r\nHe might not have had that moment had it not been for an eagle on the par-5 8th in Monday’s first round. Coming off a double-bogey on the par-3 7th to go 2-over for the tournament, Anthony regrouped.\r\n\r\n“It turned everything around,” he said.\r\n\r\nHitting his second shot to 25-feet, Anthony knocked home the big bird to get himself back to even-par before closing out the first round with a 4-under back-side, a score he would battle to keep on Tuesday.\r\n\r\n“Today [Tuesday] was a struggle,” Anthony said. “It was hard to get any momentum positively. I made two or three really dumb mental errors because I haven’t been playing much because I just had a baby that’s four months old.”\r\n\r\nThanks to Nick Moore, a close friend of Anthony’s, shooting himself out of contention, Moore was able to help keep Anthony calm and in the moment despite neither having their ‘A-game’.\r\n\r\n“Nick’s one of my best friends in the golf community,” said Anthony. “He’s just the most even-keel guy. He’s a great influence when you’re trying to get it done under the gun even though he wasn’t playing well.”\r\n\r\nMoore was tied for second with Anthony heading into the final round but was unable to carry over any momentum as he carded a final round 77 to finish in a tie for 9th at 2-over-par.\r\n\r\nAfter clinching the championship, Anthony was more emotional than he expected to be with his wife Natashia and newborn son Jackson in attendance.\r\n\r\n“I was actually surprisingly very, very emotional,” he said. “I almost teared up a little bit when I made the putt. I just love competing and then to have him there, my wife there and get the job done, it was a cool moment. I wasn’t expecting to feel that way.”\r\n\r\nIn the senior division, Jeff Wilson turned around his opening 1-over 72 with a final round 66 that was capped off with birdies on four of his final six holes. Overnight leader Mark Morgan could not keep pace with Wilson as he could only muster four birdies en route to a 3-under 68, one shot shy of Wilson's pace.\r\n\r\n",

    "articleText": "Holding off a former champion, Torey Edwards claimed the 2020 SCGA Mid-Am Championship on Tuesday. The Long Beach State alum grinded his way to his first win since 2019 at Mission Viejo Country Club.\r\n\r\nPosting rounds of 68 and 71 Monday, Edwards took a one-shot lead into the final round. Tallying five bogeys over 36-holes, Edwards told AmateurGolf.com that he simply did not have his best stuff Tuesday as he matched his bogey mark over the final 18.\r\n\r\n“It was probably a little bit of nerves and just anxious energy,” Edwards said. “I knew kind of early on that it was going to be a little bit of a dog fight. The course was playing tough today. I knew I just had to hang in there today.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nStaying in the fight, Edwards managed to post an even-par 36 as he made the turn as part of the final group. Aiding him in negating three front-side bogeys was a birdie on No. 4 and a clutch eagle on the par-5 8th which was a huge momentum saver.\r\n\r\n“It gave me a really big boost and I felt like I got everything back on track but I missed short putts for par on nine and ten which brought me right back in the thick of things,” said Edwards.\r\n\r\nAs he meandered his way through the front side, a few groups ahead of him 2017 SCGA mid-am champion Dan Sullivan was on a tear.\r\n\r\nCarding four birdies to just one bogey on the front, Sullivan cut his six-shot deficit in half before continuing his charge with three more birdies on the finishing nine for a 6-under 66 just one shot behind Edwards at 4-under for the tournament.\r\n\r\nAs Sullivan waited in the clubhouse, Edwards found his putting stroke to drill home clutch par saves.\r\n\r\n“Things weren’t going well today,” Edwards said. “I just had to have a little self-talk and remind myself that I was still in it even though I wasn’t playing my best. I couldn’t get frustrated by things not going as well as I had hoped for.”\r\n\r\nCiting a 10-foot par save on No. 13, Edwards gained a sliver of momentum and immediately birdied the par-5 14th and par-4 17th to bring his round back to even-par and a one-shot victory.\r\n\r\nThe win comes just one year after a slipped disk forced Edwards to withdraw from the event which was held at his home course, Virginia Country Club. It also marks his first SCGA win since 2017 when he won the Tournament of Champions and first overall win since he claimed the 2019 Long Beach City Amateur.\r\n\r\n“It’s nice to bounce back and be able to get it the next year at a difficult golf course… I’m just excited to outlast everyone and get it done.”",

Highlighted by two eagles, Castillo holds a slim one-shot lead.\r\n\r\nAnother professional, Spencer Fletcher of Los Altos carded a 65 to hang just one back of Castillo. At 6-under finds a threesome that includes one Ryan Plodkowski. The 16-year-old grabbed the low-am lead following the first round with a 6-under 66.\r\n\r\nStarting slow, Plodkowski caught fire to close out the front side with three straight birdies closing out the front side at 4-under.\r\n\r\nCooling off with a bogey on the par-4 10th and another on the par-3 12, Pllodkowski was able to muster two consecutive birdies on Nos. 13 and 14 to get himself back down to 4-under. Capping off the day with birdies on Nos. 16 and 18, Plodkowski sits in a tie for third and just two shots back of the round one leader.\r\n\r\nHaving to find tournaments thanks to the Mountain West Conference postponing fall sports, Zihao Jin, a San Diego State senior is also in the thick of things. Jin kept his scorecard clean en route to carding a 5-under 67. Bookending the front side with birdies to make the turn at 2-under, Jin stayed consistent. Draining back-to-back birdies on Nos. 14 and 15, Jin was able to finish on a high note with a birdie on 18 to end the first round three shots back of Castillo in solo third.\r\n\r\nFour more amateurs have work to do heading into the second round but nonetheless are still in great position as the event marches on.\r\n\r\nKento Yamawaki, Inigo Izuzquiza, Trip Morris, and Trent Hirdler are all 2-under and tied for 15th with 36-holes remaining.",

This makes running a tournament with a national field practically impossible.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n3000 miles to the west, the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/9220/Stocker-Cup-2020-Invitational\">Stocker Cup</a> was also forced to cancel when a series of COVID-19 restrictions made running the event impractical.\r\n\r\nHeld in honor of Peter Stocker and played at the inspiring Preserve Golf Club near Carmel, Calif., the championship is analagous to the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am of the PGA Tour, where top-ranked mid-amateurs team with 'B' players and compete for individual and team titles.\r\n\r\nFrom the Stocker Cup Committee:\r\n\r\n\"Given the current restrictions due to Covid-19, it would be difficult to run the kind of event we are accustomed to.

    "teaser": "The Jayhawk senior was a silent assassin as he chased down the leaders at Buffalo Dunes GC",
    "articleText": "The Kiwi from Kansas comes through at the High Plains Amateur. Beginning the day five shots back of the round one leader, Sion Audrain, Hillier had a simple approach to the final round at Buffalo Dunes Golf Course.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“Just take it shot by shot,” Hillier told AmateurGolf.com. “I couldn’t really worry about what the guys behind me were doing.”\r\n\r\nShot by shot is exactly what Hillier did. Missing out on three straight birdie opportunities to begin the day, Hillier finally came through with a 15-foot eagle on the par-5 4th. Staying consistent through the remainder of the front side, Hillier was bogey-less as he made the turn at 2-under.\r\n\r\nTrading a bogey on No. 11 with a bogey on No. 12, Hillier got his second-round score back to 3-under with a birdie on the par-5 14th, a hole he bogeyed the day prior.\r\n\r\nForgetting to scoreboard watch as he came to the final five holes, Hillier stood on the gas pedal as he came into the homestretch.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t have many expectations,” Hillier said. “You just kind of have to focus and post a low number.”\r\n\r\nWith ignorance being bliss, Hillier allowed his game to free up as he played more and more aggressively. Ripping driver on the par-4 16th, he “manned up” and got it on the green to give himself an easy two-putt birdie. \r\n\r\n“Thinking you’re two or three back with a couple to go, knowing you have to make a couple of birdies to even have a chance...to man up and be aggressive, that builds a lot of confidence going into other events when you’re under pressure,” said Hillier.\r\n\r\nNot quite done with his final act, Hillier went on to birdie Nos. 17 and 18 to close out the day with a 6-under 66 and a tournament score of 7-under 137.\r\n\r\n“I walked off the 18th hole and my playing partner goes ‘congratulations’,” recalled Hillier. “I go ‘what’s that?’ and he says ‘I think you won.’ and I said ‘uh I don’t know about that.”\r\n\r\nNot knowing he was three clear of the final couple of groups, Hillier was simply playing almost like it was a casual Sunday afternoon round.\r\n\r\nThe win definitely boosts Hillier’s confidence as the Jayhawk heads into a hopeful senior fall season. The Big 12 has yet to organize a set of guidelines for golf as the SEC announced guidelines and schedules for their member schools last week. \r\n\r\nAs a native of New Zealand, Hillier went home following Kansas’ tournament at Bandon Dunes in March. Staying with his parents for 2-3 months, Hillier could no longer handle the ‘luxuries’ his mom and dad provided so he hopped back over to the U.S. where he bunked with his older brother, and former Jayhawk golfer himself, Charlie in Kansas City, Missouri.\r\n\r\nDespite the uncertainty, Hillier and the Jayhawks are preparing for the fall just as if 2020 were a non-pandemic year.",

    "teaser": "Two Englishmen and close friends battled at Royal Birkdale for more than bragging rights",
    "articleText": "With 36 holes separating them from glory, two longtime friends settled the 125th Amateur Championship at Royal Birkdale.\r\n\r\n“It was quite relaxing having one of my good mates out there with me,” Joe Harvey told the R&A. “But we were both out there to win so between shots we would have a little bit of a chat, but coming up to our shots we were in the zone.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nFirst to take a lead, Joe Long broke the stagnant match between his close friend, Harvey, with a birdie on the par-4 5th. Splitting the 6th with birdies, Harvey squared the match back with a par on the par-3 7th. Ending the three-hole volley, Long regained a slim lead via concession on the 8th.\r\n\r\nNabbing wins on the 10th and 11th, Long saw his lead swell to 3 up. Maintaining the lead until he conceded the par-5 15th and lost the par-4 16th, he managed to gain back a 2 up lead via a birdie on the 17th, taking the lead into the halfway point of the match.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon 18, the duo split see-sawed four of the first five holes (Nos. 19-23) with pars taking the wins on holes 19, 21, and 23 as Long saw his lead trimmed to just 1 up. Firing back-to-back birdies on Nos. 8 and 9, Long regained a 3 up lead through 25 holes.\r\n\r\nHarvey, attempting to stop the bleeding, grabbed a par win on the 27th (No. 9), stubbing Long’s momentum for the time being as the group made the turn in the home nine.\r\n\r\nUnable to curb Long’s tenacity, Harvey dropped the 28th and 29th holes to fall to the largest deficit he saw so far; 4 down. On the 14th tee (No. 32) it seemed as though Harvey had a small window of opportunity to cut Long’s lead and extend the match.\r\n\r\nWith the reality of the match creeping in, Long had to buckle down and settle his nerves.\r\n\r\n“Walking up to the tee on 14 (the 32nd hole) my heart was racing,” Long said. “But I got over my tee shot and stuck to the process, thinking about where I wanted to hit it on the green. I hit a really solid shot and then over the putt, I was looking at the line and almost forgot about what comes with it if I hole it and Joe [Harvey] misses. It literally just missed.”\r\n\r\nNot quite executing to his abilities, Long left himself a mile to get into tap-in range. With roughly 40-feet separating him from the hole, Long was able to split the par-3 with Harvey to make the match dormie heading into the 33rd hole (No. 15).\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nObviously needing to make something happen, Harvey was able to get on in two and had a look at eagle to win the hole and extend the match to the 16th (No. 34). Missing the eagle putt by inches, Long was able to see the line to match Harvey’s birdie and secure the championship.\r\n\r\n“Goosebumps really,” Long said as he recalled the putt. “As soon as I holed it, it all hit me. I am just so pleased and can’t believe it really. It’s all so surreal.”\r\n\r\nOf course, with every victory, comes a loss on the other side.\r\n\r\n“I was so happy for Joe when he holed that putt,” Harvey said. “But as a golfer, I was gutted that my chance to win had come to an end. I am so tired after a long week, so my emotions are a bit all over the place.”\r\n\r\nDisappointed with the result, Harvey still has yet to hang his head about his performance saying that “If you had said at the beginning of the week that I would be in the final, I don’t think I would have believed you. I am really chuffed with the way it all played out this week.”\r\n\r\nAs for Long, aside from being named the 125th Amateur Champion, maybe the most exciting thing that awaits him is a spot in the 149th Open Championship.\r\n\r\n“It’s going to be incredible,” exclaimed Long. “This is what I have worked hard for since I started playing golf. I really stuck in there and battled… I am going to enjoy the experience of playing in The Open. It’s just going to be huge.”",

However, this go around, there is much more than just bragging rights on the line. The winner of Sunday’s championship match will receive exemptions into the 149th Open at Royal St. Georges, the 2021 U.S. Open, and the 2021 Masters.\r\n\r\nHarvey cruised to the semifinals with a morning session quarterfinal win over Denmark’s Victor Svendsen 4&3. I the semis, Harvey met Ireland’s Mark Power.\r\n\r\n3 up after six holes of play against Power, Harvey turned up the heat on the back nine. Tallying a win on the par-4 10th, Harvey’s lead was trimmed on the par-3 12th, his first loss since No. 7.  Recouping the 4 up advantage on the 14th, Power simply ran out of holes following his win on the 15th, losing the match 3&2 to Harvey after a halve of the 16th.\r\n\r\n“It’s just unbelievable,” Harvey told the R&A. “I’m overwhelmed with emotion right now. I played great out there today. He [Power] had a go at the end when I went four up, and I nearly messed it up. But I got a good up and down on 16 to halve the hole and win.”\r\n\r\nOn his path to the final, Joe Long absolutely dominated his quarterfinal match, winning 6&5 over fellow Englishman Barclay Brown.\r\n\r\nIn the semifinals, Long sought battle with another countryman, Jake Bolton. Putting up a much better challenge against Long, the two Englishmen duked it out through the 17th green with Long coming away with a 2 up victory.\r\n\r\n“Jake was playing quite nicely,” Long said. “He had a birdie putt on the 4th and I just kept it in play. I missed a few putts but I didn’t let that get to me because I committed to the shot. I just kept on trying to hit it in the fairway and trying to make pars. That was the main thing. I had a few birdie chances which I missed but, overall, I just stuck with it really. I battled hard. That’s what you have to do.”\r\n\r\nWith both finalists being good mates, there is a sense of comfort as the pair head into the 36-hole championship match on Sunday.\r\n\r\n“A couple of weeks ago we [Long and Harvey] were actually just playing in a midweek medal together,” said Long. “So, we’ve known each other for a while and we are really good mates. This is going to be played in great spirits and we’ve got to both go out there and enjoy it really. Enjoy the experience and enjoy the challenge.”",

    "articleText": "Stanford’s Aline Krauter claimed her first major title at West Lancashire in Liverpool on Saturday.\r\n\r\nThe German national defeated 2019 champion Emily Toy (England) in the morning’s semifinal match 2&1 to earn her spot in the 18-hole final on Saturday afternoon.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHer opponent? Englishwoman Annabel Fuller. Fuller cruised to the final match with a morning win against Italy’s Emilie Alba Paltrinieri 5&4.\r\n\r\nKrauter fell 3 down quickly through the first four holes. Despite the deficit, Krauter was confident in her abilities to mount a comeback.\r\n\r\n“I was three down early, but I didn’t panic,” Krauter told the R&A. “It was a rough start but I knew that I had my game and I had played well all week. I wasn’t really worried at that time. I made a great putt from off the green on the ninth which was good.”\r\n\r\nSnagging her first win on the par-5 5th with a birdie, Krauter took another birdie win on the par-3 6th to trim Fuller’s lead to just 1 up. Turning the match on its head, Krauter tied the match on the par-4 8th to get the match back to all square before she tallied another birdie win on the aforementioned par-4 9th to obtain her first lead of the match.\r\n\r\nWith five wins over a six-hole stretch (Nos. 5-10), Krauter never looked back. With a par win on the par-4 10th, Krauter had all the momentum she needed to ice last week’s English Women’s Open Amateur Stroke Play champion in Fuller.\r\n\r\nExtending her lead to 3 up on the par-3 12th with a par, the match then turned stagnant over the next three holes. Not going down without a fight, Fuller made a valiant effort to mount a comeback of her own with a birdie win on par-5 16th and a par on the par-3 17th, cutting Krauter’s cushion to just 1 up as they headed to the 18th tee.\r\n\r\n“I hit a bad shot on the 16th and 17th wasn’t great as I had a bad lie in the bunker,” Krauter said. “But on the 18th I don’t think I’ve ever been so scared for a two-putt. It ended up working out.”\r\n\r\nSettling her nerves, Krauter was able to two-putt for par and halve the last for a 1 up championship victory.\r\n\r\nWith the win, Krauter is now exempt (as an amateur) into the AIG Women’s Open, U.S. Women’s Open, The Evian Championship, and the Augusta National Women’s Amateur.\r\n\r\n“I’m now so excited to play in the AIG Women’s Open,” Krauter exclaimed. “I’m honored. I watched Sophia (Popov) win last week, it was amazing. I had a club fitting with her in February before COVID-19 when everything was fine. To play in the event next year at Carnoustie will be amazing.”",

    "articleText": "After two days of stroke play, just eight players can keep their names in the pot as the weekend approaches Royal Birkdale.\r\n\r\nIreland’s Mark Power is keeping title hopes alive for his countrymen as a win would give Ireland back-to-back Amateur titles. Defeating England’s Jack Dyer 2&1 in the morning session, Power met Germany’s Marc Hammer in a battle of forces. Power took a 3 up lead through seven holes when Hammer buckled down to get the match back to 1 up in Power’s favor through No. 15. Clinching the win with a birdie, Power now has a date with this year’s English Men’s Amateur runner-up, Callan Barrow, in the quarterfinals.\r\n\r\n“I feel like I am easing into it now,” Power told the R&A. “I have won every game 2&1 but every game is different and I feel like I am ready for any challenge.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nEnglishman Joe Harvey was quick to secure his spot in the quarterfinals after defeating fellow countryman Islam Habebul 5&4.\r\n\r\n“I was six up through 10,” Harvey said. “I played really solid on the front nine. Islam is a great golfer but he made a few mistakes early on and I capitalized.”\r\n\r\nBarrow, who faces Power on Saturday, advanced by way of knocking out one of the best amateurs in the world. Benjamin Schmidt (No. 49) picked up an ‘L’ as he was defeated 4&3 by Barrow. In the afternoon session, Barrow defeated Switzerland’s Loris Schuepbach 5&4 to set up a match against Power in the semifinals.\r\n\r\nDenmark’s Victor Svendsen played solidly to eliminate Callum Farr (England) 4&2 to match up with Joe Harvey.\r\n\r\n“It was a tough match,” Svendsen said. “I thought it was going to be a very short day because Callum played some really nice shots on the first couple of holes. I thought I could be in trouble and that I really needed to get myself together which I did. It was a good match; it was fun being out there and feeling my heart pumping.”\r\n\r\nIn the lone match to go the full 18 in the afternoon, fellow Dane Hamish William Brown defeated Marc Boucher (Ireland).\r\n\r\nSaturday will see the remaining field cut from eight to just two as quarter and semifinal play will take place, making way for the 36-hole championship match on Sunday.",

    "articleText": "Defending champion Emily Toy (England) is joined by Annabell Fuller (England), Aline Krauter (Germany), and Emile Alba Paltrinieri(Italy) as the final four women standing at the Women’s Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\nToy, who has had a remarkable defense run after making match play on the cutline on Wednesday, advanced with a thrilling 19 hole victory over Lithuania’s Gile Bite Starkute.\r\n\r\nPrior to the afternoon win, Toy needed all extra holes to move past Chloe Goadby (Scotland) to the quarterfinals. Winning the 18th thanks to a Goadby water ball, the two players halved the 19th before Toy grabbed the win on the 20th to set up the quarterfinals match with Stakute.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n4 down through 10, Toy stormed back as she knocked in a tough up-and-down on the 18th before taking the win on the 19th.\r\n\r\nSurviving 39 holes of golf on Friday, Toy faces Aline Krauter at 8:30 am local time as she looks to make it to the championship match to successfully defend her title.\r\n\r\n“You have to stick around, not give your opponent anything or give away cheap holes,” Toy told the R&A. “It’s a case of digging in deep and my confidence levels then rose. After 39 holes, I’ll sleep well tonight!”\r\n\r\nComing off a win at the English Women’s Open Amateur Stroke Play Championship last week, Annabell Fuller continued her skilled birdie sniping with four birdies over her first seven holes against Elite Wight opponent Alessia Nobilio (Italy). Not going down without a fight, Nobilio earned wins on the back nine to bring the match back to all square on the 18th tee. Taking aim from 192-yards out in typical windy English conditions, Fuller put her approach to two-feet, netting her the win and a spot in the semifinals.\r\n\r\n“That shot from 192 yards is one of the best of my career,” Fuller said. “I’ve had a few that have been important. It felt so good to do it. After being up on the back nine and then dropping a couple of shots, and then Alessia making a birdie two on the 17th, I felt on 18 I really needed to get it together. After she just missed the green with her third shot, I thought it might be my chance to get it close, and two feet kind of helped!”\r\n\r\nFuller faces another Italian in the semifinals as she takes on Emile Alba Paltrinieri.\r\n\r\nBoth matches are set to tee off before 9:00 am local time. 18 holes are set on the dockett before Sunday’s 36-hole title match.",

    "teaser": "Former UCO Broncho goes 16-under at South Lakes Golf Course",
    "articleText": "Breaking 60 is not only one of the most difficult things to do in golf but one of the hardest things to accomplish in sports.<br><br>\r\n\r\nScottie Scheffler became just the eleventh PGA Tour member to break 60 at the Northern Trust just last week. Jim Furyk is the only PGA Tour player to post two sub-60 rounds in competition as he holds both a 59 and a 58 on Tour.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFormer University of Central Oklahoma golfer Alexander Hughes didn’t just break 60...he obliterated it.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHughes joined a junior golfer on August 27 to show the junior the ins and outs of South Lakes Golf Course in Tulsa, Oklahoma prior to this weekend’s OJGT event at the course.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd boy did he lay the course out beautifully.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHughes carded a 16-under-par 55 on a round that was somewhat played on a whim. Joined by a random twosome, Hughes dazzled the group with a round of a lifetime.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOpening the round with a measly par, Hughes quickly made it a round to remember as he secured an ace on the 155-yard par-3 2nd. A mere footnote to his round, the star of the show was Hughes’ putter.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062803.jpg\"><br>Photo courtesy of TJ Eckert<br><br></div></div>\r\n\r\nHaving not been putting up to his standards, Hughes stopped by Golf Galaxy two and a half hours before teeing it up at South Lakes. Replacing his oversized grip with the classic tour velvet ‘pistol’ grip on his ever-so-trusted PING Redwood blade, Hughes was given back the feel he grew accustomed to growing up.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I just took it out there,” Hughes told AmateurGolf.com. “It felt really good in my hands, I was trying to slow my tempo down putting-wise. I just kind of hit a groove.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nGrooving better than Studio 54 in the ‘70s, Hughes went 7-under over a six-hole stretch to close out the front nine with a 26.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I knew it was pretty special after the eagle on nine,” he said. “That was about a 20, 25-footer that rolled in for eagle. From there I was just like ‘Alright, I guess keep going lower, keep doing the same thing.’ I just kept the ball rolling.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nJust as golf would have it, even a 55 has its trouble spots. Hughes went wayward off the par 4 11th tee and was inches from being out of bounds, up against a fence. Taking his medicine, he opted to flip over his 9-iron and brought out his inner Phil Mickelson to give himself an up-and-down opportunity from around 100 yards out of the left rough. Lobbing a three-quarter 60-degree to 20-feet, Hughes told himself “There’s no reason I can’t knock this in.” Avoiding spike marks, the ball trickled in for his first par since No. 3 to keep the momentum going.<br><br>\r\n\r\nComing back with a birdie on No. 12, Hughes felt as though he dropped shots with back-to-back pars on Nos. 13 and 14. On what Hughes calls “the only negative thing that happened during the round”, he missed an 8-foot birdie putt that simply did not break and grazed the left edge for a tap-in par.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThrough 14, all Hughes needed to do was go 1-under the rest of the way to post a 59. With the par-5 15th ahead of him, he had other plans. Taking advantage of his length, Hughes got on in two and once again relied on his putter to make up for his ‘mistake’ pars.  Sinking a 35-foot eagle on 15 to go 13-under on the day, reality began to creep into his head.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“Right when I did that the two random guys I was playing with were losing their minds,” Hughes said through a laugh. “When I rolled that in I was like ‘okay’ I think I was in the 50s at that point. So I was kind of thinking about it but I was confident all day.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nLike a pitcher throwing a perfect game, Hughes knew what he needed to get done, and trusted the stuff that got him there.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“That’s kind of the attitude I’ve always had,” said Hughes. “I’m not too worried about things. It’s been helpful to me in my golf career, but its also been sometimes not so helpful. Golf coaches have talked to me about that in the past.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith the help of Pat Bates and Josh Fosdick who were Hughes’ coaches at Central Oklahoma, Hughes has found a balance of his naturally fiery competitiveness and his laidback mindset to help him get to where he is today.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFollowing the eagle on No. 15, Hughes tallied three more birdies to close out the round and put himself in the record books not only at South Lakes but globally. Per Golf Channel, Rhein Gibson, an Australian who played for Oklahoma Christian posted a 55 at River Oaks in Edmond, Oklahoma just two hours southwest of Tulsa back in May of 2012. And in 1962, Homero Blancas shot a 55 at a local tournament at Premier Golf Club in Longview, Texas, although that course measured just over 5000 yards. To everyone’s knowledge, these rounds are the lowest attested and verified scores ever recorded.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to his future in golf Hughes is hoping to break through on the professional level as he is currently a pro but has missed the cut all three All-Pro Tour events he has played. With a degree in criminal justice and a strong support group, Hughes has a bright future ahead of him no matter which path he chooses.",

    "articleText": "After two rounds of match play on Thursday, England’s Emily Toy is still alive in her bid to defend her British Women's Amateur title at West Lancashire Golf Club.\r\n\r\nThe 22-year-old, who claimed victory at Royal County Down last year, is aiming to become the first player since Sweden’s Louise Stahle in 2005 to retain the championship.\r\n\r\nBut her defense was on a knife's edge in the stroke play qualifier. After bad weather reduced qualifying to 18 holes, Toy struggled to a 78 and only progressed to match play via scorecard playoff.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nToy saw off the challenge of fellow Englishwoman Isabelle Simpson with a one-hole win in the morning before following it up with a comfortable 5&4 triumph over Ireland’s Jessica Ross.\r\n\r\nEmily Price, who won the English Women’s Amateur Championship earlier this month and was among the leading stroke play qualifiers, is also still alive, beating Hulda Clara Gestsdottir from Iceland 2&1 to reach the last-16.\r\n\r\nThe day started with an emotional contest between sisters that went to the final hole.\r\n\r\nDenmark’s Amalie Leth-Nissen – who was the leading qualifier on card countback – lost out to her older sister, Cecilie. It was a notable triumph, given Cecilie is ranked 765th on the World Amateur Golf Ranking compared to Amalie at 47th.\r\n\r\nHowever, Scotland’s Hannah Darling, 17, the Girls’ Under-16 Open Champion in 2018, then ended the hopes of Leth-Nissen in the afternoon with a one-hole victory.\r\n\r\nOf the other leading qualifiers from Wednesday, Rosie Belsham lost to Annabel Bailey by one hole and Carolina Melgrati from Italy also exited at the 19th to Wales’ Ffion Tynan.\r\n\r\nLaura Webb, the oldest player in the field at 57, won her first match before Tynan took her out with a 2&1 victory.\r\n\r\nItalian Alessia Nobilio, the world number five, quietly went about her work to reach the last-16, while two German players, Paula Schulz-Hanssen and Aline Krauter, also progressed. Lily May Humphreys, the highest-ranked English player in the field, now faces Schulz-Hanssen tomorrow.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was disappointment for home club member Hollie Muse and Scotland’s Hazel MacGarvie as they exited at the last-64 stage.\r\n\r\nThe match play continues tomorrow, with the last-16 and quarter-final ties played, ahead of Saturday’s semi-finals and the 18-hole Final. There are significant rewards for the champion with exemptions into the AIG Women’s Open and traditionally, the US Women’s Open, The Evian Championship and Augusta National Women's Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\n<i>Thanks to the R&A for the information in this report.</i>",

Unlike the U.S. Amateur, where a playoff pares the field down to exactly 64 players for match play, the British Amateur allows everyone tying for 64th place to enter match play, with a select group of players having to play a preliminary round of match play to get the field to 64. Four matches were played in that first round this morning.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nOnce the field was pared to 64, England’s Benjamin Schmidt, the top ranked player in the field, played solid golf to record a 3&2 victory over Brandon Dietzel of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe 18-year-old advances to meet Callan Barrow after the Englishman, who finished runner-up in the English Men’s Amateur Championship, defeated Lewis Irvine of Scotland 2&1. \r\n\r\n16-year-old Ruben Lindsay of Scotland, who led qualifying and received the top match play seed, was knocked out 2&1 by Ilari Saulo of Finland who had previously disposed of England’s Sam Bairstow 3&1 in the first round of matches in the morning.  \r\n\r\nThe Finnish Amateur Champion will now go head-to-head with Victor H. Sidal Svendsen of Denmark who beat Ben Chamberlain of Wales by one hole.  \r\n\r\nThe most anticipated match of the day was one between two winners of prominent English titles.\r\n\r\nHaving qualified for the match play stage by a single stroke, Frenchman David Ravetto, who won the Brabazon Trophy last week, went head-to-head with the English Amateur champion Jack Cope. Opening with a birdie, Ravetto went one-up after the first before comfortably winning the match 5&4. He will now play Marc Hammer of Germany on Friday after he earned his place in the next round by winning his match 2&1 over Rasmus Karlsson of Finland.       \r\n\r\nThomas Plumb, a member of the 2019 Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, got off to a fast start, taking a six-up lead at the turn and cruising to a 4&3 victory over Robert Moran of Ireland.\r\n\r\nPlumb will now face fellow Englishman Callum Farr in the third round after he progressed by defeating Davide Buchi of Italy by one hole.\r\n\r\nDrawing inspiration from Padraig Harrington, Ireland’s Mark Power won his match against Jannik de Bruyn of Germany thanks to a 2&1 victory. He advances to play England’s Jack Dyer in the last-32.   \r\n\r\nThis is only the fourth time The Amateur Championship has been hosted at Royal Birkdale following the previous stagings in 1946, 1989 and 2005. \r\n\r\nThe match play stage continues tomorrow with the last-16 and last-eight ties, with the winner in Sunday’s 36-hole final gaining exemptions into The 149th Open at Royal St George’s next July and by tradition, an invitation to play in the Masters Tournament and an exemption to the US Open.\r\n\r\n<i>Thanks to the R&A for the information in this report.</i>",

West Des Moines’ Gene Elliott knew that all too well to a certain extent this week at the 42nd Iowa Senior Amateur at Crow Valley Golf Club, a place he grew up playing.\r\n\r\n“That’s what I told the members here at Crow Valley,” Elliott said. “But this isn’t my home golf course anymore. I have been over every inch of property at this golf course and probably have had every putt out there.”\r\n\r\nElliott (+5), who finished with rounds of 74-73-71 (218), got off to a quick start in Wednesday’s final round, with an opening nine holes in 32 (-3). A couple slight bumps in the road on holes 14-16 made things more interesting down the stretch, but with two pars to finish, Elliott won his fifth Iowa Senior Amateur title by a shot over Muscatine’s Tom Norton (+6), who posted his own final round 71 (E).\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nElliott admitted, regardless of how many times you’ve played at Crow Valley GC one thing remains the same – the difficulty of the greens are nothing to lose sight of.\r\n\r\n“These are some of the toughest greens in the midwest,” Elliott said. “It doesn’t matter how many times you have played here, the putts are still hard.”\r\n\r\nElliott, who recently played in the U.S. Amateur in Oregon, a tournament loaded with ‘kids’ much younger, said it’s good to be back competing against players over 50.\r\n\r\n“It’s nice playing with my own age group,” Elliott said. “As long as I am still standing, we’ll go for a sixth (title) next year.”\r\n\r\nIn the Super Senior Division, Marshalltown’s Rob Christensen (above right) outlasted fellow Marshalltown resident Pat Ryan by eight shots overall after a fine final round of 70 (-1), including a near hole-out to end his tournament on the par three 9th hole.\r\n\r\n“That was a nice way to finish,” Christensen said. “I birdied a lot of par threes this week.”\r\n\r\nChristensen commented that he was able to pick up a lot of ‘home course’ knowledge during his practice round and without a doubt that was the key to his success in the Quad Cities this week.\r\n\r\n“I owe a lot to Bill Tank, a member here (at Crow Valley),” Christensen said. “He took us around during our practice round and told us where to hit, not to hit it. He said whatever you do, do not be above the hole. That was the key for me, I kept it below the hole all week.”",

    "articleText": "Just like the Women’s Amateur,  the Men’s Amateur was impacted thanks to strong storms on Tuesday, forcing the R&A to shorten stroke play qualifying to just 18-holes for each championship.\r\n\r\n16-year-old Scotland native Ruben Lindsay was able to tame the 10-time Open host Royal Birkdale with a 4-under 67 to claim the No. 1 overall seed as match play is set to begin Thursday morning.\r\n\r\nThe 2019 Scottish Boys’ Amateur Champion tallied four birdies and an eagle en route to his stroke play victory. His morning match will be accompanied by Sam Bairstow in the Round of 64.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“I am very pleased, I played some really good stuff out there,” Lindsay told the R&A. I just didn’t really make any mistakes until the last. I am really pleased with that round.”\r\n\r\nSeeing just two bogeys in the duration of his round, Lindsay secured the top spot by a single spot Englishman Mason Essam who posted a 3-under 68 to claim the No. 2 seed. \r\n\r\nEngland’s Sam Broadhurst would have had a shot at the top spot if it weren’t for a pesky triple-bogey on the 3rd.\r\n\r\n“Obviously it was not the ideal start, I blocked a 9 iron into the rough and it was quite thick so I struggled to get it out,” Broadhurst said. “Walking off the green I was thinking there was a lot of golf to be played and par-5’s to take advantage of so I knew it wasn’t the end of the world.”\r\n\r\nBroadhurst recovered well and finished with a 2-under 69, good for a tie for third.\r\n\r\nThe Round of 64 will be cut to 16 with two rounds of play Thursday with the championship match set for Saturday.",

    "articleText": "Five players led the way Wednesday at a weather-shortened stroke play portion of the Women’s Amateur Championship. \r\n\r\nAmalie Leth-Nissen (Denmark), Carolina Melgrati (Italy), and a trio of English women; Rosie Belsham, Emily Price, and Isabelle Simpson all tallied rounds of 1-under-par to claim the top five seeds in the 2020 Women’s Amateur.\r\n\r\nThe field of 91 was trimmed to 64 after one round of play due to Tuesday’s round of stroke play being squashed due to torrential rains. Wednesday’s round was delayed an hour due to high winds in the Liverpool area.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nPrice, who won the English Women’s Amateur earlier this month, surprised herself knocking home three birdies en route to her 1-under 71.\r\n\r\n“Starting the round with high winds and the rain we had, I wasn’t expecting [to shoot] under par,” Price told the R&A. “I got off to a slow start, but I was solid from then and had a good back nine with three birdies. I’ve been playing well recently and it’s good to keep my form going.”\r\n\r\nLeth-Nissen finished strong as she carded three birdies on her final five holes to secure a first-round match which will renew her sibling rivalry with her sister, Cecille, during Thursday’s morning session.\r\n\r\n“My sister, Cecille, is here this week too,” Leth-Nissen told the R&A. “We train a lot together, always play in the same tournaments, and hope for the best for each other.”\r\n\r\n2019 champion Emily Toy (England) made match play by the skin of her teeth on the 6-over cut line. Ninth-ranked Lily May Humphreys also snuck in on the cut line which was decided by a card countback.\r\n\r\nTwo-time Senior Women’s Amateur champion, Laura Webb, posted a 3-over 75 to make match play as the 18-seed and will face Lily Huerliman in the Round of 64.\r\n\r\nBarring any further delays, the field of 64 will be trimmed to 16 with a morning and afternoon match play session set for Thursday.",

    "articleText": "40-year-old John Ramsey battled his way to his first individual Chicago District Golf Association title, claiming victory at the 28th Illinois State Mid-Am Championship hosted by Edgewood Valley Country Club in La Grange, Illinois.\r\n\r\n“It was the most comfortable day and I can’t be thankful enough for that,” Ramsey told the CDGA. “I play with Chadd (Slutzky) all the time, I’ve got my good buddy on the bag and I’ve played quite a few rounds with (John) Ehrgott. So the comfort of the day really helped.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nWith a comfortable yet buttoned-up atmosphere in the final group, Ramsey got off to a hot start following a self-proclaimed “horrible range session” prior to the final round. Tallying three-straight birdies to begin the round, Ramsey quickly took the lead from Ehrgott as he was 1-under for the tournament standing on the fourth tee.\r\n\r\nCarding two more birdies on Nos. 7 and 9, Ramsey went out in 31 and was two shots clear of Ehrgott as the pair made the turn making the championship a two-man race.\r\n\r\nBiding his time, the two-time Illinois Mid-Am champion Ehrgott put the pressure on Ramsey after carding back-to-back birdies on Nos. 13 and 14, shrinking Ramsey’s lead to just one shot. But, for Ramsey, having the one contender playing in his group was something he was once again comfortable with.\r\n\r\n“It was nice to have your opponent right there with you, so I think that helped me a lot just to see what he was doing to kind of play off of him,” Ramsey said.\r\n\r\nEhrgott had an opportunity to sneak through the crack in the door he worked hard to get open on the par-5 16th. Leaving himself pin-high and just off the green in two while Ramsey had to battle an awkward stance and was 100-yards from the hole with his third, both players walked away with pars, essentially closing the door on Ehrgott.\r\n\r\nFollowing up the par on No. 16 with a bogey on 17, Ehrgott gave Ramsey a two-shot cushion heading into the par-4 18th.\r\n\r\nUsing the cushion, Ramsey raked in a bogey on 18 to claim the title with a 4-under 68 and a tournament total 2-under 214.\r\n\r\n“It feels really good,” said Ramsey. “This is kind of the one I’ve been looking for, for a long time and it feels really good to finally do it.”",

    "title": "ICYMI: Sample is youngest MET Open champ in its 105-year history",
    "teaser": "High schooler Luke Sample was the first amateur to win in 15 years and the youngest in over a century of Metropolitan Opens",
    "articleText": "Luke Sample of Old Oaks stole the show during Thursday’s final round, shooting a 3-under 68 to win the 105th Met Open Championship Presented by Callaway to become just the 8th amateur in the championship’s history to do so. Sample, 17, also becomes the youngest player to ever win the Met Open, shattering the record previously held by Johnson Wagner when he won as an amateur at 21. He’s also the first amateur to win in 15 years, since John Stotlz won at Old Westbury.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nSample started his final round two shots off Gore’s 7-under lead and in the penultimate pairing thanks to two under-par rounds of 69-68. After a messy double bogey on the par-3 fourth hole, he bounced back with a par on No. 5, and then began a birdie barrage to jump to the top of the leaderboard. “It was a frustrating one for sure, [the tee shot on four] was probably my least committed swing of the week, and it wasn’t an easy par from where I left myself, and it also wasn’t an easy bogey. Unfortunately I walked away with a double but Cole [Ekert, his caddie] kept me in there once again, he did such a great job of keeping me positive and not letting me go sideways this week,” he said.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“We hit the reset button on the next hole and almost holed it from the fairway, and ended up making par unfortunately. Once six rolled around we said we have two par-5s coming up, let’s at least birdie the par-5s and get to the back nine and make a run there.”<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E4q73B8u3ik\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>\r\n\r\nSample did birdie the par-5 sixth, but didn’t stop there. He kept his birdie streak going on Nos. 7, 8, and the par-5 9th to take a two shot lead. “I said it yesterday, I’d been kind of waiting for the putts to roll in and the approach shots finishing closer than 15-20 feet, and I finally got a couple that finished at 3 or 4 feet, and had a couple of kick-in birdies,” Sample said.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“Cole once again helped me pick some great targets. The one into 8 was really just a lucky break to hit it to within 2, 3, feet, and I had no business going at that pin. I hit a pretty hard push to the right and just happened to finish two feet from the hole. Those are the kind of breaks you need in a tournament like this.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nOn the 505-yard ninth, his chip from about 20 feet short of the green nearly went in, but he settled for a tap-in birdie. “I had a very similar pitch shot into nine yesterday, which was my final hole, and pretty much just hit the same exact shot, but this time I converted for birdie which was helpful going to the back,” he shared.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSample started off the back nine with his fifth consecutive birdie on no. 10. “I told Cole going to the back nine, if we get one or two more, I think two definitely, it gives me a really good chance to run away with this, but I also said we don’t need to force anything because people can still go backwards and there’s no need to put myself in a hole I don’t need to be in.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nOn the par-4 12th, he played aggressively and sent his drive nearly 50 yards past where other competitors had been placing their tee shots. “I got to 12, and I think most people have been laying up back there and hitting a long iron or a three-wood off that tee, and I just kind of felt like we should keep the momentum going and just went full send on a driver, and it worked out,” Sample said. It worked out just fine – his second shot got him to within two feet for this sixth birdie of the day.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThrough 12, he was 9-under and four shots clear of the rest of the field. Meanwhile, 2015 champion Ben Polland of Deepdale was finished with his round and in the clubhouse with at 5-under and what turned out to be the low round of the day with a 67, due to four birdies in his final round and no bogeys on the card. Fairview’s Paul Pastore was making a run and got to 6-under through 11, but he then struggled with back-to-back bogeys on 13 and 14. A birdie on 17 brought him at 5-under, matching Polland’s score.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMichael Graboyes of Watchung Valley and Jay Card of Gardiner’s Bay both finished with 3-under totals and matching rounds of 71-69-70. Graboyes had four consecutive birdies of his own on 6-9, and had two more on the back, struggled with bogeys on Nos. 13, 16, and 18.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBy this point, Sample had recovered from a bogey on the par-3 14th, after two putting from the front of the green of the 15th. He kept his play consistent the rest of the way in with pars, finishing his back nine at 1-under to sign for a final round 3-under 68 and the win.  <br><br>\r\n\r\nSecond round leader Jason Gore of Hamilton Farm was in the final pairing but struggled with three bogeys early on his final round. A birdie on nine helped the scorecard, but a double on the par-4 13th set him back a couple more shots. He birdied 18 for the second consecutive day to finish with a 3-over 74, bringing him to 4-under and a T4 finish in his first Met Open.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAlso finishing at 4-under was Steve Shellock of Suneagles, who put together rounds of 70-70-69 this week. Shellock grabbed the lead early on during the final round thanks to birdies on Nos. 2, 3, and 6 to make the turn at 3-under. He only recorded one bogey, on 14, but kept his round under-par for the third-straight day.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith his win, Sample becomes just the eighth amateur in the championship’s 105 year history to add his name to the Walker L. Trammell trophy. “There are some pretty spectacular winners on there. I don’t think its quite set in yet and it might not for a while, but hopefully this isn’t the last time I get to put my name on there, and just being able to be a part of that history is really special,” he said.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSample has had a spectacular summer of golf. In July, he qualified for both the 118th Met Amateur and 65th Ike MGA Stroke Play championships at a join qualifier at New Jersey National. That same afternoon, he went on to Rockaway River to begin his run to the 103rd Met Junior title, which he won on July 15. Later that month, he qualified for the Met Open with a 4-under at Cherry Valley (N.J.), and two days later finished in third place at the MGA Carter Cup at Canoe Brook (where his caddie, Cole Ekert, finished as the runner-up). With not one day of rest in between, he headed to Bethpage Black for the 118th Met Amateur. He advanced to the finals, and after a great stretch of golf was defeated by champion Jack Wall.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter the Met Amateur, Sample finished in the top-10 at the Ike at Darien just last week, but also found time to practice for Mountain Ridge. “I went to work on some chipping and pitching and then started working hard on the putting again. I got the putting back again this week to where I felt like I was at the Met Junior, which was really big,” he said.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSample held off a number of other top players for his win, including Casey Pyne of Stanwich, who he was paired with today. Pyne shot a final round 75 to finish at 1-under for the week, along with Ethan Ng (a) of Knickerbocker, Sam Goldenring (a) of Brooklake, Pat Fillian of Echo Lake, and Luke Graboyes of Wachung Valley.  <br><br>\r\n\r\nHeaded into his senior year the Trevor Day School in Manhattan and already verbally committed to play at Duke, Sample can proudly say he had a successful summer of golf, capped off by a record breaking win at Mountain Ridge. “It means everything. Last year [at Piping Rock] I thought I played some amazing golf, and finished, I think, outside of the top 30, and to be able to come back from that a little bit of heart break at the Met Am, and just show myself and show everybody that I can compete at whatever level that I’m put against, it means everything.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nMoutain Ridge was once again the ultimate host for the club’s fourth Met Open Championship. Previous Met Opens at Mountain Ridge were won by Tom Nieporte (1966), George Zahringer, another amateur winner (1985), and Mike Gilmore (2000). Since last hosting the Met Open in 2000, the classic Donald Ross layout has gone through extensive changes, highlighted by tree removal and restoration work led by architect Ron Prichard. Superintendent Cliff Moore and his staff had the course in supreme condition to challenge this year’s competitors.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe top 25 players from this year’s championship are exempt into the 106th Met Open Championship, to be played at Hudson National Golf Club.",

    "articleText": "Russell Williams and Jason Schultz took it to the Bentwater Yacht & Country Club’s Weiskopf Course over the weekend.\r\n\r\nThe duo picked apart the track en route to a 26-under total which featured rounds of 60-64-66 as they picked up a 3-stroke victory.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“It was very nerve-racking,” Williams told the TGA. “I’d never been in that position. But I’ll tell you what, I had the best partner in the field. He was solid all week and I’m just glad that the two or three times a round he needed a little pick up I was able to do that and contribute.”\r\n\r\nTallying 26 birdies and an eagle over 54 holes of golf, the pair meshed together nicely as they only birdied the same hole three times and had five holes where one player birdied while the other bogeyed making it a true team win.\r\n\r\n“It was a fun environment from start to finish,” Schultz said. “We kind of just built from day one and kept going from there.”\r\n\r\nPlaying one more round, Williams and Schultz may have been able to catch Dustin Johnson’s remarkable 30-under performance at the Northern Trust at TPC Boston this past weekend.\r\n\r\nIn the senior division, Mike Peck and Steve Love snagged the win in dramatic fashion.\r\n\r\nOn the ninth (their closing hole) the team needed a birdie to avoid a playoff with clubhouse leaders Lewis Stephenson and John Pierce who were at 19-under. Love struck his approach to just 12-feet above the hole, giving the team a great look at birdie. As Peck cleaned up a lagged birdie attempt for par, the stage was set for Love.\r\n\r\n“It’s exciting for me because I don’t get to do this as much as Mike,” Love said. “Mike held us together the whole back nine. It was amazing the putts he was making for par. We kind of teamed it up and got through it, so it was really exciting.”\r\n\r\nLove knocked home their 23rd and most important birdie of the championship to claim the victory.\r\n\r\n“Anytime you win one of the TGA’s major tournaments it’s truly an honor,” Peck said.“It’s fantastic to do it with a great friend. It was a team victory and couldn’t have been any better.”",

Luke Potter took that saying to heart at the 121st Southern California Golf Association Amateur Championship this week.\r\n\r\nThe 16-year-old Arizona State verbal commit needed a three-hole aggregate playoff to become the youngest champion in the event’s storied history.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nBeginning the day five shots back of the overnight leader, Caden Fioroni, Potter simply destroyed the front-nine at Goose Creek Golf Club, posting a 28 going away. The opening laser show featured four consecutive birdies which was capped off with an eagle on the par-5 7th giving Potter a five-hole stretch at 6-under par. \r\n\r\n“Starting out five-back, I knew I had to put a low one out there,” Potter told the SCGA. “Just give myself birdie chances and putt well… [it] was a good week.”\r\n\r\nComing off of the U.S. Amateur last week where he was the youngest competitor in the field, Potter said that, “golf’s a funny game, so I just came here with an open mindset.”\r\n\r\nShooting a final round 62 was good, but it still was not enough to the job done or even earn the low round of the tournament.\r\n\r\nThat honor belonged to Fioroni. Carding a third round 61, the incoming Pepperdine freshman had a chance at 59, needing a birdie on the 18th. Posting a bogey, the new Wave settled for a 9-under day.\r\n\r\nFioroni, holding a one-shot lead heading into the 18th on Friday, needed a par to claim the championship. Having two-putts to secure the win, Fioroni blew his birdie attempt 10-feet by, leaving too much meat on the bone as he cleaned up for bogey giving Potter a chance in a three-hole aggregate playoff.\r\n\r\nStarting on the par-3 16th, Potter was able to pull off an up-and-down while Fioroni took a bogey. On the 17th, Fioroni gained the stroke back with a sidewinding 15-footer for birdie while Potter saw his birdie attempt slide by.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th, the pair fired tee shots up the left side leaving perfect angles into the green. Fioroni found the center of the green but left himself a downhill 30-footer while Potter left himself a much more attractive birdie look with an uphill 20-footer.\r\n\r\nAs Fioroni burned the edge, the scene was set for Potter. Burying the putt, Potter spoiled the opportunity for Pepperdine to go back-to-back (Sahith Theegala, 2019).",

Picking up back-to-back birdies on Nos. 2 and 3, he was able to make up the shots that overnight leader and 2015 champion Tim McKinnis had over Jolliffe.\r\n\r\nStill two-shots back of McKinnis, Jolliffe snagged another birdie on the par-4 6th to go out in 33, making up ground on McKinnis. Unable to take the momentum past the halfway house, Jolliffe carded bogeys on Nos. 10 and 12 to fall back to even-par for the championship.\r\n\r\nFive shots back of McKinnis as the pair stood on the 14th tee, things began to turn back in Jolliffe’s favor. Making back-to-back birdies once again, this time on Nos. 14 and 15, Jolliffe saw a three-shot swing as McKinnis tallied a par and a bogey on the same two holes.\r\n\r\nApplying pressure once again, Jolliffe carded a birdie on the 18th as McKinnis slipped with a bogey on 17 and a crucial bogey on 18 which gave Jolliffe the comeback win to best McKinnis and a charging Michael Holloway (2019 champ) by a single stroke.\r\n\r\nSean Thayer (4th; E) and Steve Newman (5th; +1) rounded out the top five.",

But why play with your age group when you can still beat the best of the 55+ senior set instead?\r\n\r\nSimson added to his Hall of Fame resume (he was inducted into the National Senior Hall of Fame in 2012) with a record-extending 7th win at the North & South Senior at the Pinehurst Resort, closing with a bogey-free 4-under 68 to overtake <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/54137/Gene-Elliott\">Gene Elliott</a> (W. Des Moines, Iowa) and win by two shots.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe ageless Simson has won this event in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2015, 2016 and 2020. He has now won four times since turning 60. Even more impressive, he now has a record 9 Putter Boy trophies, collecting the first two by winning the North & South Amateur in 1995 and 1996.\r\n\r\n“No, it never gets old,” Simson said to Alex Podlogar of Pinehurst. “To have my name up there nine times – seven Seniors and two regulars – nobody else has got that accomplishment.\r\n\r\n“I try to keep as much room between them and me as I can.”\r\n\r\nSimson had not won a national senior event since winning the North & South Senior in 2016, although he nearly got a third U.S. Senior title in 2017 to go along with his three British Senior titles.\r\n\r\nRound 1 was played on the Pinehurst No. 5 course, and there was a logjam of six players (including Simson and Elliott) tied at the top at 2-under 70.

Even better, he hit every green in regulation on one of the toughest courses in the world to do so, with No. 2's turtleback greens repelling any shot not well-placed. (Simson said it was the first time he had ever achieved the feat at No. 2.) He started well with birdies at the 1st and 3rd holes, added another at the 11th, and got a final birdie at the par-5 16th to close with a 68 and beat his age by a shot.\r\n\r\nElliott still had the lead at the turn after going out in even par, but couldn't make a birdie on the back nine, dropping two shots and finishing with a 74 for a 1-under 215 total, three behind Simson in third place.\r\n\r\nPlaying with Simson, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/9194/Sherrill-Britt?p=1\">Sherrill Britt</a> (West End, N.C.) stayed within a couple of shots all day but ultimately could not catch his playing partner, closing with a 70 to finish solo second at 2 under par.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/1916/Robert-Funk\">Robert Funk</a> (Canyon Lake, Calif.) posted three rounds of even-par 72 to finish 4th, tied with <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22349/Monty-Guest?p=1\">Monty Guest</a> (Solon, Ohio), who was a part of the first-round lead group and who close with a pair of 73s.\r\n\r\nAmong past champions, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/4457/Pat-Thompson?p=1\">Pat Thompson</a> (2013) finished tied 11th at 3 over, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/12360/Eddie-Hargett?p=1\">Eddie Hargett</a> (2018) was tied 20th at 8 over, and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/117060/TODD-HENDLEY\">Todd Hendley</a> (2017) was tied 24th at 10 over.\r\n\r\nIn the Super Senior division, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/12725/Stephen-Fox?p=1\">Stephen Fox</a> (Barboursville, W.V.) defended his title with a resounding nine-shot win over <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/12649/Robert-Parmar?p=1\">Robert Parmar</a> (Fairhope, Ala.) and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/10341/Evan-Long?p=1\">Evan Long</a> (Charlotte, N.C.).

    "teaser": "Hitting it long doesn't help if it's in the wrong direction. Callaway's new Big Bertha B21 offers a best of both worlds design",
    "articleText": "You can learn a lot watching the new breed of Tour players on TV. The day of the short hitter being successful on Tour is long gone. <br><br>\r\n\r\nSo what do we do? We chase distance of course. Not just because the professional game has changed, but because it's fun. Until the missed fairways start creeping into our scores.<br><br>\r\n\r\nCallaway's got you covered.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Carlsbad, California-based company continues to show they are interested in more than winning the weekly driver count on worldwide tours (although they do that quite often). Which is exactly why they designed a driver (and product family) built for distance any way you swing it. Long, forgiving, and easy to hit. That's what Big Bertha B21 is all about.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Big Bertha B21 is Callaway's first driver to deliver the unique combination ofhigh launch, low spin and significant draw bias in a forgiving head shape. It’s a new formula for distance, built to take the big miss out of your game so you can play from the fairway more often.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Big Bertha B21 consists of a total ball speed package; Callaway's A.I. Designed Flash Face SS21, Super Strength Materials, and Tour-proven Jailbreak Technology that can help you hit it a long way even if you miss the sweet spot. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIt's a driver designed for players who are looking for a new way to get the most distance out of their swing.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>KEY PRODUCT FEATURES</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Unlock Your Inner Distance</b><br>\r\nIf you want to hit the ball farther, you have to hit it straighter. And to help eliminate a slice orbig miss, Callaway engineers designed their first high launch driver with an ultra-low forward CG for low spin.It’s a new formula for distance to provide a more consistent ball flight, and more tee shots that find the fairway.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Easy To Hit From Bertha Shaping and Added Draw Bias</b><br>\r\nThe large Big Bertha head is specifically engineered with internal draw bias weighting to helpimprove your launch angles and promote a straighter, longer ball flight.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Fast Ball Speed From Callaway's A.I. Designed Flash Face SS21</b><br>\r\nCallaway has advanced their A.I. designed Flash Face to promote fast ball speeds across a more expansive area. So you’ll still hit it a long way, even when you miss the center of the face at impact. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Super Strength Materials For Consistent, High Ball Speeds</b><br>\r\nThis face architecture requires extremely strong materials that are lighter and more resilient than traditional titanium to promote optimal speed, forgiveness, and spin characteristics. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Jailbreak + T2C Triaxial Carbon Crown For Ball Speed and Unconventional Forgiveness</b><br>\r\nTwo internal Jailbreak bars connect the sole and crown to promote fast ball speed, and thesignificantly lighter carbon crown redistributes weight for a higher MOI.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Premium Components Package</b><br>Features a completely new RCH shaft, designed by Callaway to specifically enhance the BigBertha offering, with an Active Tip Flag section for easy launch.

    "articleText": "“Oh please be good!”<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/64502/Tyler-Strafaci\">Tyler Strafaci</a> begged to his ball as it flew from his four-iron toward the 18th green and the Havemeyer Trophy on Sunday.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBattling both a blanket of fog that rolled in on the final nine, and self-inflicted damage on the 34th and 35th holes, Strafaci knocked his second from 240 yards onto the par-5 18th to about 15-feet to pull off the shot of the tournament.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nTwo-putting for birdie, Strafaci looked on as his opponent <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/16411/Ollie-Osborne?p=1\">Charles \"Ollie\" Osborne</a> failed to get up and down from short right of the green to force extra holes.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe 36-hole championship match was never short on dramatics. In the morning 18, Osborne took a 5-up lead through the opening 12 holes. Undeterred, Strafaci won four of the final six holes to shave Osborne’s lead to just 1 up before the afternoon round.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the morning, the duo matched each other with 66s and were 12-under on best ball.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/bandon\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/Two-Man-Links-2021.jpg\"></a></div><br>\r\n\r\nAs the afternoon round started, Strafaci was able to keep the momentum going, tying the match on the 20th hole (No. 2). Strafaci would strike again on the 25th (No. 7) to take his first lead of the match with a 25-foot birdie.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAble to maintain the lead for another five holes, Mother Nature arrived in the form of dense fog to create a coliseum at Bandon Dunes for the gladiatorial showdown. Rangefinders were rendered useless, and at times it became impossible to see where each player was taking aim, much less where their ball went once in the air.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062648.jpg\"><br>Ollie Osborne (USGA photo)</div></div>As the marine layer cooled the temperature, it seemed as though Osborne was the one heating up. The SMU Mustang won the par-5 13th, his first win since playing the par-3 12th in the morning (a hole he nearly had an ace on twice on Sunday).<br><br>\r\n\r\nNot to be outdone, Strafaci came back on the par-4 14th (No. 32) with an eagle 2 to regain the one-hole advantage he had worked so hard for. Tallying another win with a par on the par-3 15th (No. 33) after Osborne could not keep his ball out of the penalty area left of the elevated green, Strafaci looked like he was set to wrap the championship.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut heading to the 16th, a hole that was seemingly made for such a match-play moment, the match turned in what seemed like a blink of an eye. The fog, as dense as it had been since rolling in four holes prior, made the 16th play to its truest form.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith the landing area completely obscured by the fog, both players took aggressive lines off the tee of the driveable par-4, but Strafaci drew the short straw. In a fairway bunker 83 yards from the hole, Strafaci flew the green and found the penalty area on the cliff's edge. Trying to salvage a halve to go dormie into the 17th, Strafaci hacked at his ball twice in the native grass before conceding the hole to Osborne.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe 17th did not do any favors to the Georgia Tech senior either. After Osborne hit it close from 164 yards, the Yellow Jacket dumped two shots into the penalty are short, taking the match to the 36th tee all square.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf Strafaci was reeling, he could take consolation in knowing that the 18th hole had been good to him in each of the last three matches. First it was <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18255/Agustin-Segundo-Oliva-Pinto?p=1\">Segundo Oliva Pinto</a>'s caddie committing an <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/27304/U-S--Amateur--18th-hole-penalty-shocker-helps-set-Elite-Eight\">unthinkable rules violation</a> to hand him the match, then it was a shaky lag putt to four feet that he was able to make to fend off <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/6046/Stewart-Hagestad?p=1\">Stewart Hagestad</a>, and finally it was <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21354/Aman-Gupta?p=1\">Aman Gupta</a> taking three to get out of a fairway bunker.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHe saved his best finish for last on Sunday, pumping a great drive through the fog to just over 240 yards away. Smashing a 4-iron from the middle of the fairway, Strafaci knew he executed what he visualized through the haze as soon as it came off the face.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“Oh please be good!”<br><br>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"Oh please be good!

I wanted to hit it close by hitting the best 4-iron of my life. I knew I could execute it and trusted myself.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nTapping in for birdie, the pressure was on Osborne to convert his 12-foot birdie putt after missing the green short-right. As the putt slid by, Strafaci was able to join Jack Nicklaus (1959) and Hal Sutton (1980) as winners of both the North & South and the U.S. Amateur in the same year.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFor Strafaci, it was personal. His paternal grandfather, Frank Strafaci Sr., played in 16 U.S. Amateurs, never making it past the quarterfinals (1947, 1949). In 1954 Frank was ousted by The King himself, losing to Arnold Palmer in the first round, which Palmer later cited as his toughest match of the week.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStrafaci matched Frank earlier this summer with his <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26161/North-and-South-Amateur--Tyler-Strafaci-wins-one-for-the-family\">win at the North & South</a>, and now has the family's second USGA championship to go along with the elder Strafaci's U.S. Public Links title in 1935. With his father, Frank Jr. (who played in three U.S. Amateurs himself) on the bag, Strafaci surpassed the man he never got to meet.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“He’s my best friend,” Strafaci said when asked what it meant for his dad to be on his bag this week. “I love him. It’s awesome. He’s such a good guy and my biggest supporter. To do it here with him when I didn’t think I’d have another amateur tournament is something I’ll never forget.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith the win, Strafaci gives Georgia tech their eighth U.S. Amateur title, joining Bobby Jones (five times), Matt Kuchar (1997), and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/76098/Andy-Ogletree\">Andy Ogletree</a> (2019).<br><br>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bob Jones x5, Matt Kuchar, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andy_ogletree?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@andy_ogletree</a> and now <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TyStrafaci?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@tystrafaci</a>! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GTGolf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GTGolf</a> is the first U.S. college to have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/USAmateur?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#USAmateur</a> champions in back-to-back years with different players. <a href=\"https://t.co/dihaKn6Cj2\">pic.twitter.com/dihaKn6Cj2</a></p>— USGA (@USGA) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USGA/status/1295205824768487424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 17, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><br>\r\n\r\nWith the win, Strafaci earned exemptions into the 2021 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines, the 2021 Open at Royal St. Georges, and will likely be receiving an invitation to the 2021 Masters.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs for Osborne, he will not be leaving Bandon empty-handed. As the runner up he will also receive an exemption into next year’s U.S. Open and likely a 2021 Masters invite, as well as a spot in the next three U.S. Amateurs so long as he retains amateur status (Strafaci would receive 10 years).<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I thought I played really well,” said Osborne. “I had a couple of hiccups but I thought I played great today. We were both playing really well so it was fun.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nOsborne was trying to become the fifth player from SMU to win the U.S. Amateur, joining Hank Kuehne (1998), Colt Knost (2007), <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/5477/Kelly-Kraft?p=1\">Kelly Kraft</a> (2011) and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/5358/Bryson-DeChambeau?p=1\">Bryson DeChambeau</a> (2015).<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Related Stories</b><br>\r\n<hr>\r\n<ul class=\"contentList\"><li><img src=\"//www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062628.jpg\" alt=\"Ollie Osborne to play Tyler Strafaci in U.S. Amateur Final\"><div class=\"newsLatestTeaser\"><a href=\"/golf-tournament-news/27310/Ollie-Osborne-to-play-Tyler-Strafaci-in-U-S--Amateur-Final\">Ollie Osborne to play Tyler Strafaci in U.S. Amateur Final</a><br/>Aug 15, 2020 - Two father/son combos will go at it Sunday, with Tyler Strafaci and dad chasing his grandfather Frank's legacy</li><li><img src=\"//www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062600.jpg\" alt=\"Semifinals set at U.S. Amateur at Bandon Dunes\"><div class=\"newsLatestTeaser\"><a href=\"/golf-tournament-news/27307/Semifinals-set-at-U-S--Amateur-at-Bandon-Dunes\">Semifinals set at U.S. Amateur at Bandon Dunes</a><br/>Aug 14, 2020 - Tyler Strafaci will face Aman Gupta in the first match, while Ollie Osborne will play Matthew Sharpstene in the other match</li><li><img src=\"//www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062588.jpg\" alt=\"U.S. Amateur: 18th hole penalty shocker helps set Elite Eight\"><div class=\"newsLatestTeaser\"><a href=\"/golf-tournament-news/27304/U-S--Amateur--18th-hole-penalty-shocker-helps-set-Elite-Eight\">U.S. Amateur: 18th hole penalty shocker helps set Elite Eight</a><br/>Aug 13, 2020 - No one has ever seen an ending to a U.S. Amateur match quite like the one that sent Tyler Strafaci on to the quarterfinals</li><li><img src=\"//www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062584.jpg\" alt=\"U.S. Amateur: Medalist upset in round of 32\"><div class=\"newsLatestTeaser\"><a href=\"/golf-tournament-news/27302/U-S--Amateur--Medalist-upset-in-round-of-32\">U.S. Amateur: Medalist upset in round of 32</a><br/>Aug 13, 2020 - What you need to know as the Round of 32 begins its march to the Sweet 16</li><li><img src=\"//www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062573.jpg\" alt=\"U.S. Amateur round of 64: Upsets, Waves, & More\"><div class=\"newsLatestTeaser\"><a href=\"/golf-tournament-news/27301/U-S--Amateur-round-of-64--Upsets--Waves--and-More\">U.S. Amateur round of 64: Upsets, Waves, & More</a><br/>Aug 12, 2020 - Pepperdine makes waves while the No. 1 seed overcomes the odds in the Round of 64 at Bandon Dunes</li><li><img src=\"//www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062572.jpg\" alt=\"The U.S. Amateur stroke play playoff: survive and thrive\"><div class=\"newsLatestTeaser\"><a href=\"/golf-tournament-news/27300/The-U-S--Amateur-stroke-play-playoff--survive-and-thrive\">The U.S. Amateur stroke play playoff: survive and thrive</a><br/>Aug 12, 2020 - David Tenneson looks at the recent history of one of the most exciting parts of U.S. Am week, and how it can propel its survivors</li><li><img src=\"//www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062548.jpg\" alt=\"U.S. Amateur: Wilson Furr shoots course record 62, is medalist\"><div class=\"newsLatestTeaser\"><a href=\"/golf-tournament-news/27298/U-S--Amateur--Wilson-Furr-shoots-course-record-62--is-medalist\">U.S. Amateur: Wilson Furr shoots course record 62, is medalist</a><br/>Aug 11, 2020 - In a tight race for medalist, Wilson Furr posts the round of the tournament to emerge from the pack at 11-under 132</li><li><img src=\"//www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062552.jpg\" alt=\"August Madness?

    "articleText": "As a golfer, you dream of playing links golf on a sunny day with light winds like the four semifinalists got to play in today. But as a spectator, after watching U.S. Amateur players get blown around the course, it's a bit of a letdown. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBut don't worry, calm days don't usually stay around for long on the Oregon Coast, and over the 36-hole final on Sunday we are certain to see mother nature play more of a part.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThat's not to say that it wasn't fun watching today. With no commercials, and just two matches going, the continuity of the TV coverage is amazing. There were no major rules infractions like we saw with the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/27304/U-S--Amateur--18th-hole-penalty-shocker-helps-set-Elite-Eight\">local caddie on Thursday touching the sand on No. 18 leading to a loss of hole</a>, but we did see one small penalty assessed early in one of the matches. That happened when Matthew Sharpstene was deemed to have caused his ball to move during his halted backswing on No. 5, costing him a stroke.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the first matchup today, Tyler Strafaci started out playing conservatively and waiting for his opponent Aman Gupta to make mistakes. Often laying back off the tee, Strafaci picked his spots and won thre of the first five holes, and made the turn 3-up over Gupta. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nGupta seemed to take the bait on holes like No. 5, where Strafaci hit his approach to the center of green first, from a position well back of Gupta's perfect drive to the throat of the narrow fairway. Faced with just 143 yards to a left pin, the Oklahoma State golfer pulled his short iron left and gave up the hole to a routine par.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOver the last few days, the 10th hole has been a very reachable par-4, but with so much crosswind most players wound up left of the green. Not so today, and Strafaci took the opportunity to drive the green, two putting for par and another win. 4-up seems to be the point of no return in an 18-hole match, and after missing a short par putt for a win on the difficult 11th hole, it looked like game over for Gupta.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/bandon\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/Two-Man-Links-2021.jpg\"></a></div><br>\r\n\r\nBut Gupta fought back with a huge par saving putt on No. 12, an amazing up and down from the huge swale in front of the 13th green to take the match back to 3-down, and a win at No. 15 with a double bogey (see below, it was ugly but effective).<br><br>\r\n\r\nThen Gupta hit the shot of the day. With his opponent safely on the green 15-feet away for birdie on No. 16, Gupta hit a long blast from a pot bunker short of the green that barely cleared a greenside bunker, before settling to 7 feet. He made it, narrowing the margin to one hole with two left. After being 4-down through 12 holes, the gritty player from North Carolina who only barely got into the field as a first alternate was looking to make his trip to Bandon Dunes worthwhile.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOn to No. 17, and Gupta won with a par when Strafaci missed an 8-foot par putt after finding the pot bunker off the tee. For the third-straight match, Tyler Strafaci would stand on the 18th tee all square. When Gupta missed wide right (almost in the hazard) Strafaci over corrected and pull hooked his drive into the deep heather on the left.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNerves are tough, being tired with nerves is even tougher. And Strafaci was starting to show signs of wearing down physically and mentally.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut coming making up such a deficit finally took its toll on Gupta, who took three shots to extricate himself from the fairway bunker on No. 18, leading to double bogey. Once again Strafaci (who made a nice chip to the green in three for an easy par) was faced with a whirlwind of emotions coming off the 18th green a somewhat shaken victor. \"I started having some negative self talk,\" he admitted in a post-round interview, crediting his father's upbeat coaching with helping him stay positive at No 18,  Looking to the Sunday final, Strafaci said, \"I've got to putt better tomorrow.\" \r\n\r\nThe Matthew Sharpstene vs. Ollie Osborne match was much closer, at least on the front nine. The players were even through eight holes. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBut then momentum shifted quickly, as Sharpstene lost confidence in the most important club in match play. He four putted the par-5 9th for bogey to go 1-down, made a nice birdie save from 4-feet on No. 11 but again three putted No. 11 to go 2-down. But there was no back-down in Sharpstene -- hitting second on the par-3 12th he stuffed his tee shot to 10 feet and mustered up a great stroke to make birdie and get back to 1-down.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOsborne put things almost out of reach with back-to-back birdies on Nos. 13 and 14. Despite Osborne taking an unplayable lie from the gorse on No. 15 (leading to double-bogey), Sharpstene couldn't capitalize -- missing a short putt for bogey and win. The match ended on No. 16 when Osborne won with a par, taking the match 4-and-2.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<B>SATURDAY NOTES</B><br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Featured Hole: No. 15</b><br>\r\nHave you played Bandon Dunes? If you have you know that it's one of the most scenic and challenging holes anywhere. Even without wind, we could all feel the pain of Tyler Strafaci as he missed his tee shot well short and right of the green, with a mountain to climb to get back on board. After blading his wedge over and leaving the next shot short, Strafaci had scored a triple, on a hole where a bogey would have won him the match. Gupta had his own problems, letting pitch from over the green roll right back to his feet, but he managed to compose himself and take the hole with a double-bogey.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut wait, there's more...<br><br>\r\nIn the Sharpstene/Osborne match, Osborne had to take an unplayable lie from the gorse over the green. Sharpstene missed a short bogey putt to win the hole, meaning the final four players in the U.S. Amateur played a par three hole in 9-over par. I challenge the golf historians to find a hole that saw that kind of scoring during U.S. Amateur semifinals.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>TV Coverage Scores Again</b><br>\r\nGolf Channel does a great job providing back stories and interviews - today we again heard from course architect David McLay Kidd and a live interview with owner and links golf visionary Mike Keiser, who said he \"always looked at the U.S. Amateur as a major.\" <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Dads on the bag:</b><br>\r\n It's not uncommon to see a father caddying for his son, but today was very special in that department with three of the four players having their dads loop for them. The fourth player, Aman Gupta, took his college coach Alan Brtatton of Oklahoma State -- Bratton has been on the bag of two previous champs -- Peter Uihlein at Chambers Bay in 2010 and Viktor Hovland in 2018 at Pebble Beach. But the sentimental favorite is Tyler Strafaci's dad Frank, whose own father won the USGA Public Links and back-to-back North & South Amateurs in the 1930s. Watching Frank wince after a missed putt? Priceless.",

    "articleText": "The 48th Junior Southern Championship hosted by Blessings Golf Club in Johnson, Arkansas was the of Thomas ‘Tommy’ Morrison’s first win in quite a while.\r\n\r\nThe 6-foot-8 15-year-old phenom owned the course as the only competitor in the field to post all three rounds under par (67-69-68). Morrison, who had a three-shot lead heading into the final round, cruised to a four-shot victory on Friday.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“I was in the same situation last year, leading the first two rounds,” Morrison said. “It’s been a while since I won a tournament, so it feels really good to pull off a win.”\r\n\r\nMorrison’s closest competitor was Duluth, Georgia’s Carter Loflin. Loflin was extraordinary most of the week, only having a slow start during the first round. With four bogeys to three birdies on Wednesday, Loflin tallied a 1-over 73, which could have been the difference maker to tie Morrison on Friday.\r\n\r\nQuickly turning it around on Thursday, Loflin flirted with being on #59Watch through No. 8. Going 6-under through eight, Loflin stumbled with a double-bogey to close out the front nine for a 32. Regaining the two dropped shots with birdies on Nos. 10 and 11, Loflin cooled off going even the rest of the way.\r\n\r\nIn Friday’s final round the duo was paired together with Loflin needing to make up three shots.\r\n\r\nGaining a shot on the front nine, Loflin was unable to catch Morrison, posting a 69 to Morrison’s 68.\r\n\r\nWith the win, Morrison helped the state of Texas claim the State Team competition. Hudson Weibel, Dallas (143), Jaivir Pande, Houston (144), and Sebastian Moss, Pearland (144) were accompanied by Morrison’s 136 through the first 36 holes.\r\n\r\nWe’ll continue to see plenty of Morrison’s game over the next few seasons. The high school sophomore picked up two years of AJGA exemptions, an exemption into the 2021 Northeast Amateur, the 2021 Southern Amateur, and more with the victory.\r\n\r\n",

    "teaser": "UC Davis claims its second NCGA Amateur title since 2018",
    "articleText": "Playing competitively for the fifth consecutive week, UC Davis sophomore Lucas Carper used his youthfulness to his advantage, having enough in the tank to bring himself to victory.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAs the 26-seed, Carper battled his way to the finals, never needing the 18th hole to complete his wins. Winning his matches 2&1, 4&3, 3&2, and 4&2, Carper was set to match up against 12-seed Weston Payne in a 36-hole marathon on Friday at Spyglass Hill.\r\n\r\nAlthough fatigued from five weeks of intense play and rigorous match play on a tough course this week, Carper never trailed in any of his matches.\r\n\r\n“It’s a long, long grind out here,” Carper told the NCGA. “It was really rough at times.”\r\n\r\nEven though he may have thought it was tough, Carper didn’t show it. In the championship match, he quickly amassed a 4 up lead as the duo made the quarter-post. In fact, Carper won seven of the first 10-holes while dropping one in favor of Payne, good for a 6 up lead through 10 holes of play.\r\n\r\nRather than lose focus and play lackadaisical, the big lead helped Carper stay focused, saying, “The start and early lead kept me going for the second round,” and “I had a lot of confidence entering the afternoon round.”\r\n\r\nAfter 26 holes, Payne finally chipped away enough to make a comeback seem doable. Carper was 3 up with 10 to play, which despite the amount of energy Payne had to expend to cut the lead in half, a 3 up lead is never safe.\r\n\r\nRegaining a 4 up lead on the par-3 12th, Carper teed it up on his least favorite hole; the par-4 13th.\r\n\r\n“The 13th had caused me problems all week,” Carper said. “I was thankful to get that par at that moment.”\r\n\r\nCarper was able to seal the championship on the par-3 15th with a 4-iron from 229 that was close enough to be conceded. Payne dumped his tee shot into the water, essentially ending the match.\r\n\r\n“This is my biggest win ever,” said a tearful Carper. “It hasn’t sunk in yet. It’s unreal to win and have my mom and dad out there with me. It means so much.”\r\n\r\nCarper became the second UC Davis player to claim the championship as Thomas Hutchinson won it back in 2018.\r\n\r\nIn the senior bracket, Rich Petit and Tom Ansbro needed extra holes to crown a champion. \r\n\r\nPetit fell 3 down early in the 18-hole match before clawing his way back to drawing it all square on the 17th before halving the 18th to force extra holes.\r\n\r\nTaking the win on the second playoff hole, Petit took home his first NCGA title.",

As we have seen throughout the week, momentum shifts quickly during windy afternoon matches, when players have to factor wind on even the shortest of putts. <br><br>\r\n\r\nOne player who has done a great job of managing the wind is Ollie Osborne of Reno, Nevada. Osborne was 4-up against Cameron Sisk before losing four-straight holes on the back nine. Facing a huge shift in momentum, Osborne flighted down an iron on the windswept par-3 15th to the back of the green and two-putted to win the hole and take back control of the match. He will play Matthew Sharpstene in the semifinals.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nTyler Strafaci, the recent North & South Amateur champion, is in the process of chasing his grandfather's golf legacy.

After Hagestad left his par putt \"just short\" on No. 17 to go 1-down, Strafaci's match again went to No. 18. But this time he knocked it on the par-5 in two and two putted for birdie. To his credit, Hagestad made one of the best runs by a mid-am in recent U.S. Amateur history.

We were so little growing up playing so many tournaments with her, playing against her. But we're really good friends, and I'm really happy to be going to Columbia with her.”\r\n\r\nPaik made quick work of all of her opponents, never having to use Nos. 16, 17, or 18 to secure her wins. Playing four matches, Paik only needed 56 holes, winning 25 of them outright.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“I think the first four holes on this course really fit my eye,” said Paik. “There are two really gettable par fives that I can make birdie. And then the second hole, I actually eagled it in one of my matches. I think getting off to a fast start is really important.”\r\n\r\nFor Walsh, she was again the bridesmaid, making it to the championship match last year but, just like this year, was unable to come through for the win. As a consolation, Walsh was able to come through at the Ouimet Memorial and was runner-up at the Massachusetts Girls’ Junior Amateur.\r\n\r\nFriday morning saw the future teammates win their semifinal matches to set up the all-Columbia final. Walsh needed 21 holes to defeat Rebecca Skoler while Paik cruised to a 4&3 win over Mary Mulcahy.\r\n\r\nAs the 8-seed, Paik surpassed her semifinal finish in 2016. Hitting eight greens in regulation, and seven of 10 fairways in regulation, the 12 hole match proved to be the biggest margin of victory in the past decade at the Massachusetts Women’s Amateur.\r\n\r\nBoth Paik and Walsh will have to wait to begin their collegiate golf careers as COVID-19 has put a halt on all Ivy League sports through at least the fall.",

The Redmond, Washington native posted rounds of 65-69-73 for a 9-under 207 and a 1-shot victory.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nTaking a 5-shot lead into the third and final round, Kato immediately double-bogeyed the first while his playing partner and closest competitor, Boise State’s Brian Humphreys. Through two holes, Kato allowed a three-shot swing to cut his lead down to just two.\r\n\r\nMaking the turn three shots better than Kato, Humphreys was hot on his tail, making up the 5-shots from when the duo began the day as they stood on the 16th tee. Humphrey wasn’t alone. Zachary Stocker, who began Thursday eight shots off the lead, was also tied with Humphreys and Kato but was one group ahead of the leaders.\r\n\r\nStocker, who also doubled the first, carded two eagles in his effort to shoot a 5-under 67 but his round fell just short as he finished two shots back of Kato.\r\n\r\n“Today was a really hard day,” Kato told the WGA. “Brian Humphreys played unbelievable, and I just gutted my butt off the last four holes and just found a way to hit some shots down the stretch. It was really cool to be there. It has been a while since I’ve been in that spot, and to feel the nerves was really cool.”\r\n\r\nKato and Stocker dueled down the stretch with Kato’s birdie on No. 16 being the difference-maker. Needing an eagle on the par-5 18th to give Kato a final run, Stocker was unable to apply the pressure, matching Kato with birdies to close the tournament.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what it is like to have his name on the same trophy as Freddie Couples and current hot-hand on the PGA Tour Joel Dahmen, Kato said, “It feels awesome. Honestly, it hasn’t sunk in yet. It is such an honor to be on that trophy with all those names, and something I’ll cherish forever.”",

Here are the highlights from a wild afternoon at Bandon Dunes:<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n<b>A Walk-off penalty</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nGeorgia Tech’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/64502/Tyler-Strafaci\">Tyler Strafaci</a> faced a pair of Arkansas Razorbacks on Thursday. In the Round of 32, Strafaci squared up against <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/16919/Julian-Perico?p=1\">Julian Perico</a>, defeating him 2&1, setting up a match with Perico’s soon-to-be roommate <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18255/Agustin-Segundo-Oliva-Pinto?p=1\">Segundo Oliva Pinto</a>.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHolding no more than a 2 up lead for 11 holes throughout the day, Oliva Pinto fought back with wins on Nos. 13 and 16 to get the match back to all square. With the match tied on the 18th, Oliva Pinto hit his approach into a greenside bunker, while Strafaci was just off the front of the green. As sometimes happens at Bandon, the wind had blown much of the sand in the bunker, so that Oliva Pinto's ball was on an exposed spot where sand had been displaced.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt was then that Oliva Pinto's caddy stepped into the bunker and reached down to the sand, appearing to brush the surface multiple times with his hand. A rules official was called over, and though the caddy denied that he was testing the sand, television replays clearly showed him doing so.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe penalty for this is loss of hole, so just like that the match was over and Strafaci was declared the winner.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It all came down to the 18th hole.<br><br>And then this happened. <br><br>The outcome?

He’s a great kid and he played great, we both played great. And for that to happen I just feel really bad for him.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen asked how he would move forward, Strafaci replied “I’m going to make it [the win] worth something. I’m going to go out tomorrow and try to win my match and keep moving.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nOlvia Pinto was preparing for the shot, unaware of his caddy’s actions.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“At this point, it doesn’t really matter,” Oliva Pinto said. “What happened happened. He can say anything, but it won’t change what happened.”<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I’ll definitely try to use the positives I learned this week.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nStrafaci will face the red-hot mid-am Stewart Hagestad as he tries to put Thursday’s finish behind him.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>A Run at History</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/6046/Stewart-Hagestad?p=1\">Stewart Hagestad</a>, the 2016 U.S. Mid-Am champion, is playing for more than a win at Bandon Dunes. Playing in his 20th USGA championship and 10th U.S. Amateur, the two-time Walker Cup team member became the first to secure his spot into Friday’s quarterfinals.<br><br>\r\n\r\nCurrently No. 15 in the WAGR rankings, Hagestad is looking to play his way into the U.S. Open. With qualifying non-existent this year due to COVID-19, the USGA created exemptions for the top seven amateurs in the WAGR rankings. So far, Hagestad’s efforts are looking good. Claiming a 4&3 victory over <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22608/Harrison-Ott?p=1\">Harrison Ott</a> who took out this year’s medalist <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/59313/Wilson-Furr\">Wilson Furr</a> in Thursday’s morning session, Hagestad continues his quest to become just the second player to win both the U.S. Mid-Am and U.S. Amateur in his career. <br><br>\r\n\r\nJay Sigel is the only player to do so, winning the Amateur in 1982 and 1983 and the Mid-Am in 1983, ‘85, and ‘87. Hagestad also has an opportunity to become the first mid-am to win the U.S. Amateur since John Harris did so at 43-years-old in 1993.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Ollie, not Ozzy</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nSMU’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/16411/Ollie-Osborne?p=1\">Charles ‘Ollie’ Osborne</a> is seeking to join the likes of <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/5358/Bryson-DeChambeau?p=1\">Bryson DeChambeau</a> as the fifth Mustang to win the U.S. Amateur.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHalving just once and dropping No. 7 to <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/25183/Carson-Lundell?p=1\">Carson Lundell</a>, Osborne took a 6 up lead as the pair made the turn. Far from a road to nowhere, Osborne kept applying pressure. Halving the 10th and losing the 11th, Osborne sealed the deal with a birdie on the 138 par-3 12th and a par on the par-5 13th, punching his ticket to face Arizona State’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24203/Cameron-Sisk?p=1\">Cameron Sisk</a> Friday afternoon.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Sisk-ty Six</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24203/Cameron-Sisk?p=1\">Cameron Sisk</a> is living right. Coming off a 79 in the opening round of stroke-play, Sisk carded a 66 to get into the 18-man playoff for the final three match play spots. The first one to emerge from the playoff, Sisk took the 62-seed, a seed that has good vibes in recent history. <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18771/Doc-Redman?p=1\">Doc Redman</a> rode the 62-seed all the way to the championship in 2017.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/27300/The-U-S--Amateur-stroke-play-playoff--survive-and-thrive\"><b>Related: </b>The U.S. Amateur stroke play playoff: survive and thrive</a><br><br>\r\n\r\nSisk continued his streak of hot play with a 4 up win over over West Virginia’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22269/Matthew-Sharpstene?p=1\">Matthew Sharpstene</a> with a 25-foot dagger that cut through the wind on the highly exposed greens that have wreaked havoc all week at Bandon. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/bandon\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/Two-Man-Links-2021.jpg\"></a></div><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Aman Corner</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nOklahoma State’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21354/Aman-Gupta?p=1\">Aman Gupta</a> is keeping head coach Alan Bratton’s caddying resume in tip-top shape. In search of becoming the third Cowboy to win the U.S. Amateur with Bratton on the bag, Gupta took down Texas A&M’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/136069/sam-bennett\">Sam Bennett</a>. Bennett could not buy a putt in the windy conditions on the back nine, burning edges on four putts inside 10-feet. Never looking comfortable over the ball while trying to calculate both break and wind, the most painful lip-out came on the 14th to keep the match at 3 up in favor of Gupta. Clinching the match on the par-3 15th, Gupta moves on to the quarterfinals and will face <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18850/Michael-Thorbjornsen?p=1\">Michael Thorbjornsen</a>.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n<b>Drop the Hammer</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18850/Michael-Thorbjornsen?p=1\">Michael Thorbjornsen</a> continues to roll. After defeating Sweden’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/25150/Hugo-Townsend?p=1\">Hugo Townsend</a> in the morning, the incoming Stanford freshman took on one of two Argentinians to make the Sweet 16. <br><br>\r\n\r\nMaintaining a consistent lead over <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/16195/Mateo-Fernandez-de-Oliveira?p=1\">Mateo Fernandez de Oliviera</a>, Thorbjornsen was 2 up at the halfway point. Getting back to his winning ways, Thorbjornsen built his lead to 4 up. Attempting a comeback, Fernandez de Oliviera grabbed wins on Nos. 12 and 15 thanks to clutch putts. However, it was Thorbjornsen who got the win on No. 16 after flirting with the coastline off the tee for a two-putt par and a Friday tee time with Gupta.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b> Slow & Steady </b> <br><br>\r\n\r\nLSU's <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/44821/Philip-Barbaree\">Philip Barbaree</a> and Pepperdine's <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24757/William-Mouw?p=1\">William Mouw</a> rounded out the day as the last match to close out the eventful day at Bandon. <br><br>\r\n\r\nPutting lights out all week, Barbaree took momentum early from Mouw as he grabbed a 2 up lead through No. 9. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Pepperdine Wave was not going to go down without a fight as Mouw rallied with par wins on Nos. 11 and 12 to bring the match back to all square. Just as it looked as though Mouw was going to complete the comeback to continue his solid summer, Barbaree shut the door winning three of the final five holes thanks to some creative shot-making but despite having to make a difficult bogey putt on 17 to close it out.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBarbaree faces <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22269/Matthew-Sharpstene?p=1\">Matthew Sharpstene</a> in the quarterfinals Friday afternoon.<br> <br>\r\n\r\n<b> Sharp as a Knife</b> <br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22269/Matthew-Sharpstene?p=1\">Matthew Sharpstene</a> was a quiet assassin on Thursday. While the 'big names' and controversy took the headlines and much of the TV broadcast, Sharpstene was methodical in his 4&3 win over <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21915/Davis-Chatfield?p=1\">Davis Chatfield</a>.<br><br>\r\n\r\nLosing only one hole in the match, Sharpstene was 1-over through 15 despite the brutally windy conditions. Playing smart and not forcing anything, Sharpstene can be one to keep your eye on Friday, and possibly even Saturday.<br> <br>\r\n\r\nLive coverage of the quarterfinals begins at 6:00 pm EST on NBC's free live streaming app Peacock and will switch over to the Golf Channel at 7:00 pm EST.",

Sending seven to the event, three Waves advanced to match play. Clay Feagler won his match 4&3 over Eddy Lai, William Mouw continued his solid summer with a 3&2 win over Jordan Batchelor. The lone loss for the Waves on the day came at the hands of Notre Dame’s Davis Lamb who beat Joey Vrzich 2&1. Pepperdine was among three schools that had seven representatives at Bandon (Oklahoma State & Texas Tech). <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Upsets</b> <br><br>\r\n\r\nWith match play comes plenty of upsets. Most notably today was 62-seed Cameron Sisk defeating 3-seed Ben Shipp 5&4. Shipp, an NC State senior, led just once on the opening hole of the match. Sisk, a rising junior at Arizona State, took control of the match on the second hole and never looked back. Taking a 2 up advantage at the turn, Sisk won holes Nos. 12, 13, and 14 to ice the match. <br><br>\r\n\r\nOther notable upsets include 61-seed Sam Harned 4&3 over 4-seed Travis McInroe; (59) Noah Norton 3&2 over (6) David Ford; (48) Spencer Tibbetts 2&1 (17) Michael Brennan; (41) Tyler Strafaci 4&2 over (24) Kelly Chinn. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/bandon\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/Two-Man-Links-2021.jpg\"></a></div><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Mid-Ams</b> <br><br>\r\n\r\nFive mid-amateurs made it to Wednesday’s Round of 64.

After defeating Argentinian Abel Gallegos 1 up, Hagestad will face Spencer Tibbetts at 7:10 am PST as he continues to compete in his 20th USGA championship. <br><br>\r\n\r\n“I wasn't as nervous as I was in years past,\" Hagestad said. \"It's not in any way to say that I didn't care, but I was a little bit more comfortable with the position. Obviously, you hope you win, but if you play great and get beat, that's easier to take. I knew that I was playing some solid golf, and if I continued to execute, hopefully, we could make it close.” \r\n\r\nHagestad has every right to be comfortable.

In 2010 at Chambers Bay he toted the bag for Peter Uihlein as Uihlein brought the program’s fourth U.S. Amateur title back to Stillwater, Oklahoma. Doing the same for Viktor Hovland in 2018, Bratton began the week looping for OSU senior Austin Eckroat. Missing the cut for match play, Bratton began bagging for alternate Aman Gupta. <br><br>\r\n\r\nGupta got into the field when Florida’s Ricky Castillo withdrew citing an injury. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Gupta fired a 6-under 137 to secure a T-5 finish and a spot in match play. As the 5-seed, Gupta took on 60-seed Van Holmgren, advancing 3&2 into the Round of 32. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>The 16th</b> <br> <br>\r\n\r\nThe risk/reward 16th played a pivotal role in multiple matches Wednesday.

Alabama’s Wilson Furr was able to survive the Round of 64 with a 6&4 victory over China’s Aaron Du. <br><br>\r\n\r\n“This is the most exciting thing that’s happened to me in my golf career,\" Du said after making the field of 64.\r\n\r\nDu snuck into the match-play portion by the skin of his teeth, sinking a 10-footer for birdie on No. 11 for the third and final spot, making for a long day for the Cal Golden Bear.\r\n\r\nFurr and the remaining 31 other players will look to continue their quest for the Havemeyer Trophy Thursday as the field will be trimmed from 32 to eight. <br><br>\r\n\r\nTelevision coverage of the event begins at 6:00 pm EST on NBC's free streaming service Peacock before flipping over to Golf Channel at 7:00 pm EST to close out Thursday's festivities.",

    "teaser": "David Tenneson looks at the recent history of one of the most exciting parts of U.S. Am week, and how it can propel its survivors",
    "articleText": "By David Tenneson<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn 1979, the USGA changed the format for their oldest championship to be a mix of stroke play and match play.  Since that time there have only been two occasions (1985 and 2000) where the stroke play stage of the event ended with a clean cutline of exactly 64 golfers to move on to match play.  All other years there has been some kind of tie around that 64th position necessitating a playoff to bridge the two stages, and this year is no exception.<br><br>\r\n\r\n18 golfers played off for the final 3 match play spots on Wednesday morning. <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24203/Cameron-Sisk?p=1\">Cameron Sisk</a>, who had a heroic comeback with a 66 just to get into the playoff after opening with 79, birdied the 10th hole at Bandon Dunes, as did <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/17710/Evan-Katz?p=1\">Evan Katz</a>. Three players were eliminated with bogeys, and the other 13 went to the 11th hole to play for the final match play spot. <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/26618/Aaron-Du?p=1\">Aaron Du</a> birdied the difficult par 4 to claim the 64th and final spot into match play.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nOver the past 20 years, the average U.S. Amateur playoff has consisted of approximately 17 golfers competing for around 7 spots, which is not a quick process. Even when the playoff concludes after two holes – such as 2010 (16-for-6), 2013 (7-for-15), and 2017 (<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/19974/How-the-13-for-8-U-S--Amateur-Playoff-Was-Decided\">13-for-8</a>), and this year – this process can still take hours for all of the golfers to finish. One of the longest and most dramatic playoffs in recent memory was last year’s 27-for-3 fight that took nearly four hours for <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21477/Austin-Squires?p=1\">Austin Squires</a> to secure the 64th and final match play slot.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>How have playoff survivors fared in the championship?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nOnce the field of 64 is finally set, the attention immediately turns to the first round of match play – the Round of 64. An interesting question is: does going through a (potentially marathon) playoff affect the chances of a player winning his match later that day?<br><br>\r\n\r\nUsing the same dataset from 2000-2019, below are the Round of 64 results for playoff survivors as well as results for the same seeds in years they were not filled by playoff survivors.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062567.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\nUsing these two tables, we’re able to get a sense of how playoff survivors tend to perform by comparing how successful a certain seed is when filled by a playoff survivor versus a player not subject to the playoff.  Focusing on seeds 52-61 where there are more than a few instances of each to compare, we see that generally speaking the playoff survivors perform better than their counterparts in the Round of 64.<br><br>\r\n\r\nPerhaps this increased success is due to the fact the playoff survivors are already somewhat warmed up or already had the adrenaline pumping with the morning playoff, or maybe it is simply worse for the higher-seeded opponents who have had to wait for the playoff to conclude before getting to face their opponent. Regardless, there is a notable difference in the first-round results for playoff vs non-playoff players.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNext, we can look how each of the groups performed in the rest of the match play rounds.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062568.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062569.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\nWhat immediately jumps out when looking at these tables is the number of championships the playoff survivors have won. Not only have they won more championships, they have also had far more seeds with Finals appearances. Moreover, they have had more seeds make semifinal runs, quarterfinal runs, and final 16 runs.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis data further solidifies the notion that as a group, the players who make it through the playoff are able to capitalize on that success with deeper match play runs than similarly seeded players who didn't have to go through the playoff. As an aside, note that the only 64th seeded player to make it to the quarterfinals in the last 20 years was Squires who followed up the grueling playoff with a magical run before losing to 17-year-old <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/26503/Cohen-Trolio?p=1\">Cohen Trolio</a>, the youngest recorded semifinalist in the tournament’s history.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Notable U.S. Amateur playoff participants</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nA number of recognizable names have appeared in these playoffs over the years. Some notable players who were ultimately unsuccessful include <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/15400/Cole-Hammer?p=1\">Cole Hammer</a> (2019), <a href='https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/13009/Jovan-Rebula?p=1\">Jovan Rebula</a> (2019), <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/9614/Scottie-Scheffler?p=1\">Scottie Scheffler</a> (2017), <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/12632/Maverick-McNealy?p=1\">Maverick McNealy</a> (2016), <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/6046/Stewart-Hagestad?p=1\">Stewart Hagestad</a> (2016), <a href='https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/12968/Curtis-Luck?p=1\">Curtis Luck</a> (2014), <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/4489/Cheng-Tsung-Pan?p=1\">C.T.

Two of these – Luck and An – would go on to win championships within two years of failing to advance in their respective playoff.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062570.jpg\"></div></div>There have been a number of players during this span that have appeared in multiple playoffs, several of which have had notable amateur and/or professional careers. Fowler has gone on to become a household name and Scheffler has enjoyed recent success on the PGA Tour after an illustrious amateur career including winning the 2013 U.S. Junior Amateur.  <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/52007/Garrett-Rank\">Garrett Rank</a> made waves in recent years with a bout of success including <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25347/Rank--31--defies-age-in-winning-Western-Amateur\">winning the 2019 Western Amateur</a>, another distinguished mixed stroke play and match play tournament.  Perhaps the most successful amateur on this list is also the only man to appear in the playoffs three or more times since 2000. <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/777/Nathan-Smith?p=1\">Nathan Smith</a> has enjoyed a distinguished amateur career that includes four U.S. Mid-Amateur victories (2003, 2009, 2010, and 2012), <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/14475/Nathan-Smith--Todd-White-win-7-and-5-for-inaugural-U-S--Amateur-Four-Ball-title\">winning the inaugural U.S. Amateur Four-Ball</a> championship with playing partner <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/1516/Todd-White?p=1\">Todd White</a>, and three consecutive Walker Cup appearances from 2009-2013.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThere have been four instances since 2001 where playoff survivors have faced off against each other, a feat that can only occur in the Round of 16 or later.  \r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062571.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\nIncredibly, the 2012 Finals match featured two players to make it through the 17-for-14 playoff.  There were only two other occasions – 2005 (19-for-17) and 2003 (14-for-12) – where an all-playoff survivor match-up was nearly realized.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>All eyes on...</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/26618/Aaron-Du?p=1\">Aaron Du</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/17710/Evan-Katz?p=1\">Evan Katz</a> and <a hef=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24203/Cameron-Sisk?p=1\">Cameron Sisk</a>.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe three survivors of the 18-for-3 playoff at Bandon Dunes, as would be expected, have difficult first-round matches. Du plays <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/59313/Wilson-Furr\">Wilson Furr</a>, the medalist who <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/27298/U-S--Amateur--Wilson-Furr-shoots-course-record-62--is-medalist\">shot a course-record 62</a> at Bandon Trails. Katz faces the #2 seed <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22165/James-Piot?p=1\">James Piot</a> who shot 69-65 in qualifying, and Sisk plays the #3 seed <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18627/Benjamin-Shipp?p=1\">Ben Shipp</a> who shot 68-67.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut after beating the odds once already, all three players have to feel like they are \"playing with house money\", and as the data shows, they have a chance to keep the momentum going and perhaps start a deep match play run.",

    "teaser": "In a tight race for medalist, Wilson Furr posts the round of the tournament to emerge from the pack at 11-under 132",
    "articleText": "When a course hosts its best players ever, the competitive course records are bound to fall. And anyone who has ever played Bandon Trails knows that there are plenty of birdies out there. But eleven of them? In the middle of a USGA championship? That's pretty amazing.\r\n\r\nWhatever <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/59313/Wilson-Furr\">Wilson Furr</a> saw in Bandon Trails, he liked. And his 62 is the new course record. Coming off a 2-under 70 at Bandon Dunes on Monday, the amazing 9-under round puts the University of Alabama senior from Mississippi at 11-under and in firm command of medalist honors and the No. 1 seed heading into Wednesday's match play round.\r\n\r\nFurr's 11-under total was one shot shy of the tournament record, posted by Hayden Wood in 2017 at Riviera Country Club. \r\n\r\n“I mean, until you told me all that, it didn’t really hit me, to be honest with you,” said Furr, who is competing in his eighth USGA championship and fourth U.S. Amateur. “We were just trying to run our game plan all day, and I just started hitting it close and a couple putts went in, and then kind of looked up and we were 7 under through 12. Like I said, it happened real fast, so I don’t know what to say really.”\r\n\r\nThe 62 matched the second-lowest 18-hole score in U.S. Amateur history. Californian Jeff Wilson shot 62 in 2011 at The Home Course in Dupont, Washington. (The lowest 18-hole U.S. Am score ever was a 60 by Billy Horschel.)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22165/James-Piot?p=1\">James Piot</a>, a rising senior at Michigan State, took the No. 2 seed, adding a 7-under 65 at Bandon Dunes to the 69 he posted Monday at Bandon Trails. His round included eagles on Nos. 9 and 13 (both par 5s)  and consecutive birdies on 17 and 18. It was the best round of the day on the course that will host all matches. \r\n\r\nPiot told the USGA that he took full advantage of the light winds and the luck of the draw he got with tee times.\r\n\r\n“At the beginning of the week I was sending off texts to all my buddies at home, saying, ‘You know what, [the] cut is going to be 6, 7 over,’” said Piot, who is playing in his first U.S. Amateur. “With this wind and how it was looking [during] practice rounds, [I told myself] I’m going to try to score the best I can this week, and I got a fortunate draw with the weather situation.\"\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18627/Benjamin-Shipp?p=1\">Ben Shipp</a>, of North Carolina State, finished birdie-eagle at Bandon Dunes for a 5-under 67 and earned the No. 3 seed at 8-under 135. Baylor University redshirt junior Travis McInroe, of Plano, Texas, followed a first-round 65 at Bandon Dunes with an even-par 71 at Bandon Trails to finish at 136, four strokes behind Furr. Shipp won the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25841/Shipp-edges-Reband-in-South-Beach-International-Amateur-playoff\">2019 South Beach International Amateur</a> in a sudden-death playoff.\r\n\r\nFurr's record round at Bandon Trails comes just a day after the mark was set by <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21354/Aman-Gupta?p=1\">Aman Gupta</a> at 64 on Monday, and tied earlier Tuesday by <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/16411/Ollie-Osborne?p=1\">Charles Osborne</a>.\r\n\r\nGupta, one of 7 players in the field from Oklahoma State, fired 29 on the front nine at Bandon Trails yesterday on his way to a bogey free 64. Today, he struggled on the closing holes at Bandon Dunes, making bogey on Nos. 14, 16, and 17 but he did close with a birdie to round out a 1-over 73 for a two round total of 6-under 137. But it's all a bonus, considering Gupta was a last-minute addition to the field when a spot became available due to Ricky Castillo's WD.\r\n\r\nThat's tied with <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/28005/David-Ford?p=1\">David Ford</a> of North Carolina, a UNC Chapel Hill commit who earlier this summer won the AJGA Invitational, along with a PGA Tour exemption. \r\n\r\nAnd how's this for not letting a double bogey on the first hole ruin your day? \r\n\r\nYesterday, Ford made double on No. 1 at Bandon Trails. No big deal. He birdied five of the next eight holes to shoot 33 on the front nine, and posted 68 on the day.\r\n\r\nToday at Bandon Dunes, Ford again started with a double-bogey on the par-4 1st hole. He birdied Nos. 8 and 9 to get back to even on the day, then posted a bogey free 33 on the back nine to shoot 69 and tie Gupta at 6-under. Ford should be a tough match for anyone this week.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nSouthern Amateur champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22047/McClure-Meissner?p=1\">McClure Meissner</a> shot a 74 at Bandon Trails, ten shots higher than Monday at Bandon Dunes, but is still comfortably through to match play - tied with a group of four players at 5-under.\r\n\r\nIncluded in that group is past U.S. Mid-Amateur champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/4472/Scott-Harvey?p=1\">Scott Harvey</a> of North Carolina blistered his way through the front nine at Bandon Dunes to shoot 5-under 31 on his way to a 67 that puts him at 5-under 138 and easily ready for match play. \r\n\r\nHarvey will try to win a USGA championship for the second straight year at Bandon Dunes. Last year, he and his partner Todd Mitchell <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/23929/Harvey--Mitchell-finally-get-their-U-S--Amateur-Four-Ball-title\">won the U.S. Four-Ball Championship</a> on the Old Macdonald course.\r\n\r\nThere will be a new U.S. Amateur champion this year, as the defender <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/76098/Andy-Ogletree\">Andy Ogletree</a> will narrowly miss match play after rounds of 74-72 put him at 3 over par.\r\n\r\nTwo other U.S. Mid-Amateur champions are through to match play. Stewart Hagestad came home in 31 at Bandon Dunes for a 66, while Kevin O'Connell had a solid 70.\r\n\r\nOther notables making match play include last year's runner-up <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18421/John-Augenstein?p=1\">John Augenstein</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/64502/Tyler-Strafaci\">Tyler Strafaci</a>, winner of the North & South and Palmetto Amateurs earlier this summer.\r\n\r\n61 players finished stroke play qualifying at or below 1 over par. The final three spots will be determined by an 18-for-3 playoff that will tee off first thing Wednesday morning.\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Round 2 of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/USAmateur?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#USAmateur</a> stroke play featured some sizzling scores, including one of the lowest in the 120-year history of the championship! <a href=\"https://t.co/BUEWdMnPjf\">pic.twitter.com/BUEWdMnPjf</a></p>— USGA (@USGA) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USGA/status/1293546158812540928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 12, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\n<B>TOURNAMENT NOTES (courtesy USGA) </B>\r\n\r\nThe average qualifying score in the U.S. Amateur over the last 15 years is 145.2.\r\n\r\nNotables to qualify for match play include 2019 U.S. Amateur runner-up John Augenstein, 2016 U.S. Mid-Amateur champion Stewart Hagestad, 2014 U.S. Mid-Amateur champion Scott Harvey, 2018 U.S. Junior Amateur champion Michael Thorbjornsen and 2017 U.S. Mid-Amateur champion Kevin O’Connell. Hagestad’s 6-under 66 at Bandon Dunes matched the second-lowest score of the day on the course.\r\n\r\nAndy Ogletree became the first defending champion to miss the cut since Stephen Fox in 2013 at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass. The 2020 Georgia Tech graduate shot 3-over 146.Three other reigning USGA champions also failed to qualify. U.S. Junior Amateur champion \r\n\r\nPreston Summerhays had a disastrous triple-bogey 8 on the 18th at Bandon Dunes to miss by two. U.S. Mid-Amateur champion Lukas Michel came up three strokes short, and U.S. Senior Amateur champion Bob Royak posted 157.\r\n\r\nIt also was a disappointing week for several top players in the World Amateur Golf Ranking® and notable champions. Cole Hammer, the 2019 McCormack Medal winner who was on the victorious 2019 USA Walker Cup Team, failed to advance along with fellow 2019 Walker Cup Team member John Pak, 2020 Western Amateur champion Pierceson Coody, two-time Asia-Pacific Amateur champion Yuxin Lin, and 2019 Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup Team member Alex Fitzpatrick, the younger brother of 2013 U.S. Amateur champion Matthew Fitzpatrick.\r\n\r\nScott Harvey, of Kernersville, N.C., certainly has an affinity for Bandon Dunes. The 2014 U.S. Mid-Amateur champion won last year’s U.S. Amateur Four-Ball title at the resort with partner Todd Mitchell (albeit on different courses) and then shot a 5-under 67 on Tuesday at Bandon Dunes to qualify for match play. This is Harvey’s first competitive event since last year’s U.S. Mid-Amateur at Colorado Golf Club in September.\r\n\r\nHarvey was one of five mid-amateurs (25 and older) to qualify for match play. He was joined by Hagestad, O’Connell, 2019 U.S. Mid-Amateur quarterfinalist Andres Schonbaum and Derek Busby.\r\n\r\nCharles “Ollie” Osborne, of Reno, Nev., had quite the turnaround, carding a 7-under 64 at Bandon Trails after an opening-round 77 at Bandon Dunes. The 64 included six consecutive birdies from No. 5 and 10 birdies in all. The Southern Methodist University rising junior advanced to match play at 2-under 141.\r\n\r\nOsborne was one of 14 players to improve his second-round score by 10 or more strokes. Cameron Sisk (79-66) got into the playoff, but the other 12 failed to advance. Thomas Hutchison, of San Jose, Calif., had the day’s biggest improvement at 14 shots (82-68).Four players who got into the field as alternates advanced: Gupta, Hugo Townsend, Carson Lundell and Jonathan Yaun.\r\n\r\nMason Anderson, of Mesa, Ariz., withdrew before Tuesday’s second round at Bandon Dunes with an undisclosed injury.

    "title": "August Madness? A statistical look at the U.S. Amateur bracket",
    "teaser": "David Tenneson takes a historical look at the data to see how match play seeding affects how far players advance",
    "articleText": "By David Tenneson<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe 120th iteration of the U.S. Amateur is being played at the Bandon Dunes Resort on the Oregon coast. First played in 1895, the USGA’s oldest championship has gone through a number of format changes.  Since 1979, this week-long event has featured a mix of stroke play and match play in order to crown a champion from a field of over 300 of the world’s best male amateur players.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe first stage of the event consists of two stroke play rounds, and there is typically a sudden-death playoff conducted on the morning of the third day to narrow the field into a match play bracket of exactly 64 players.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThere’s something uniquely thrilling about the idea of a bracketed tournament, for spectators as much as the competitors themselves. Survive and advance, as the saying goes.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nOne of the most scrutinized bracketed tournaments in sports is the NCAA Men’s basketball tournament held annually in March.  Over the years, statisticians have collected and analyzed historical results in different ways, looking for trends that not only explain what transpired but might also help predict future outcomes.  There are a few parallels between the basketball tournament and US Amateur match play brackets.  The obvious is the 64 seeds (excluding basketball’s play-in games), but there’s also the “specialness” quality that make both extremely exciting to follow as a spectator. Even so, there are very few diehard golf fans pouring over bracket scenarios the way basketball fans do in March.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStill, it is possible to apply some of the same statistical analysis methods used on college basketball data to draw some potentially relevant trends from past U.S. Amateur results.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Analyzing historical U.S. Amateur match play brackets</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062574.jpg\"></div></div>Focusing on match play data from 2000-2019, we can collect some interesting data points.  One place to start is by analyzing the first round (Round of 64) which has fixed match-ups.  Looking at this table sorted by success rate for the top 32 of 64 seeds, we see that while being highly seeded is important, there are still some single-digit seeds (9 and 4) which have successfully made it out of the first round less than half of the time.  Furthermore, even the lowest seeds have been successful more than a quarter of the time they tee it up against players who were either stroke play medalist or within a few shots of the medalist.  Part of this might be explained by the sheer randomness of golf, where a bounce off a tree limb or rock can make or break a hole.  There’s also the notion of players reacting to their or their opponent’s scores in the golf-equivalent of “clutchness,” which baseball statisticians have been trying to quantify in their sport for years.  An additional factor that makes match play unique is the fact that no matter how out of hand a hole gets, the player can lose no more than one hole at a time (as opposed to many strokes at a time in stroke play), which in some cases skews the normal risk/reward factor.<br><br>\r\n\r\nYou might be thinking the data looks different when organized as seeds 1-64 instead of the beloved basketball-style bracket regions (with four regions of 1-16 seeds). With that in mind, what follows is the same dataset with the U.S. Am seeds adjusted to the 1-16 numbering basketball fans are used to seeing.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062549.jpg\"></div></div>As seen with the “true” 64-slot seeding, the basketball style re-seeding shows how the #1 seed is successful in the first round approximately two-thirds of the time.  Also, the higher seeds have been more successful than the lower seeds, but at a rate that is essentially a coin-flip.  Note that the #2 seed has actually had a higher success rate than the #1 seed.  When filling out NCAA tournament brackets, many fans focus on the matchups that have more balanced (50%) success rates as areas for potential upsets, such as the infamous #5 vs #12 matchup.   Using this US Amateur data table, most of the matchups are close to balanced, giving statistical backing to the survive-and-advance mindset that is amplified in golf match play where advancing to the next round is not a given for any seed.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter examining the first round U.S. Amateur results, we can then expand this notion all the way to the Finals match. The tables below show the probability of advancing to each round for all 64 seeds. One area to focus on is the rounds in which each seed has struggled. For example, the #5 seed, which is one of the most successful in the first round, has struggled to pass beyond the Round of 32.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062546.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062547.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that in the last 20 U.S. Amateurs, only three times has any of the top 18 match play seeds gone on to win. But look at seeds 19-38, where 12 of the 20 past champions were seeded, comfortably in the middle of the bracket.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe #1 seed doesn't seem to provide any assurances after the first round (or maybe two) of match play, although the \"medalist jinx\" (losing in the first match) doesn't seem to be a thing either. The one #1 seed to win in the last 20 years was Ryan Moore, who also won the NCAA Championship, U.S. Public Links, Western, and Sahalee Players championships that year (2004).\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most surprising thing of all is the fact that the bottom seeds have yielded two champions.  In fact, the bottom four seeds have been more successful in the Finals match than the top four seeds, going 2/2 compared the 1/3 success rate of the top seeds. That is some excitement that college basketball fans are statistically likely to never see.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSo what does it all mean? Potentially nothing! We just don’t have enough data here to draw any meaningful conclusions.  Even with all match play results dating back to the format change in 1979 (or even further), the whole “past performance is no guarantee of future results” adage is still a thing.  We can see that there are some statistically-relevant takeaways from looking at the historical records, but no golfer is sitting over a 15 foot birdie putt to extend the match thinking “well I was 17% more likely to win this match based on my seeding, so this putt is 17% more likely to go in.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn reality, players that make the stroke play cut aren’t usually worried about their seeding and potential match play path.  In the end, all that matters is surviving and advancing until the Havemeyer Trophy is in hand.",

    "teaser": "Playing Bandon Dunes, the Southern Am champ fired 8-under 64 while Aman Gupta posted 29-35 for 64 at Bandon Trails",
    "articleText": "Wind, what wind?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22047/McClure-Meissner?p=1\">McClure Meissner</a> showed us he could go low in the wind less than a month ago <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/27206/Southern-Amateur--Meissner-comes-from-seven-back--wins-in-playoff\">at the Southern Amateur</a>. \r\n\r\nMeissner fired 66 in the last round at Maridoe in Dallas, when par was a good score on any hole. Today at Bandon Dunes, the SMU golfer got out before the heaviest Oregon coastal winds, and fired 8-under 64 on the day.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21354/Aman-Gupta?p=1\">Aman Gupta</a> of North Carolina also fired 64, at the par-71 Bandon Trails course, 7-under on the day.\r\n\r\nThose scores make the day sound easy, but at Bandon Dunes and Bandon Trails -- two of the five main courses at Bandon Dunes Resort -- it's easy to make bogeys, or worse, if things starting going sideways.\r\n\r\nThat's the nature of links golf - and Bandon Dunes is no replica of the British Isles most famous courses, it's the real deal.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nGorgeous wavy landscapes, sand dunes, tall grasses, and of course the Pacific Ocean make every hole at the resort a feast for the eyes. But wide-eyed smiles quickly turn upside down when you're hitting into a three club wind with the ocean on your left and virtually unplayable sand dunes on the right.\r\n\r\nSo sure, take advantage of the firm fairways, strike  crisp and accurate iron shots, and hole some putts -- any of the courses at Bandon Dunes will reward that kind of play. The par-5 holes are \"gettable\" and the occasional par-4 can be driven by the longest players.\r\n\r\nMeissner, just as he did in the last round of Maridoe, had a lot of things go right today. He birdied three of the first four holes, then added two more birdies for a 31. After a slow start to the back nine, Meissner followed a birdie on No. 14 with a bogey on the par-3 15th. And if you're going to take a bogey, that's a good place to do it -- the wind blows sideways off the Pacific as you guide your ball along the coast on the left, and a two story bunker on the right 'just says no' to par if you're in it.\r\n\r\nTurning back towards the clubhouse, Meissner birdied the last three to punctuate one of the lowest competitive rounds ever posted on the main Bandon Dunes course. \r\n\r\n“I got out there early and made some putts,” said Meissner. “I got off to a hot start and then hit it really well all day. I think I only missed one or two greens. I just gave myself good looks all day. We were fortunate that they moved up a couple [tee] boxes on a couple par threes. They could have made it extremely hard on those holes, but they were nice.”\r\n\r\nFor Gupta it was all about the front nine. Gupta teed off on the front nine of the Bandon Trails Course, and as the holes turn inland, he liked what he saw.\r\n\r\nHow's a 7-birdie 29 on the front nine? \r\n\r\n“I got a new putter on Friday, and it worked out pretty well,” said Gupta. “I think I had 11 putts on the front nine, so made it pretty easy on myself.”\r\n\r\nGupta slowed his birdie barrage down on the back, but still managed nine straight pars and a bogey-free 18 hole score of 64. It was the only bogey-free round of the day.\r\n\r\nBoth Gupta and Meissner credited taking advantage of their early tee times.\r\n\r\n“Anyone with a 7:30 [a.m.], 7 [a.m.] tee time definitely has an advantage this week because we didn't have to deal with hardly any wind until I want to say our 14th hole,” said Gupta. “So it was definitely a big advantage to go in the morning and make some birdies early before the wind started to pick up.”\r\n\r\nGupta is one of seven Oklahoma State golfers in the 2020 U.S. Amateur field. He's certainly set the mark for them, and the rest of the field.\r\n\r\n<b>NOTES</b>\r\n\r\n- <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/23427/David-Perkins?p=1\">David Perkins</a>, of East Peoria, Ill. and Illinois State shot a 68 at Bandon Trails to tie for the low score in the windy afternoon wave: “It was very challenging,” said Perkins. “It was about a three- to four-club wind. Probably four. But yeah, it made it challenging. It's fun, and knowing if you played well, you were going to gain a lot of ground.”\r\n\r\n- The defending champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/76098/Andy-Ogletree\">Andy Ogletree</a> shot a 74 at Bandon Trails, while last year's runner-up <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18421/John-Augenstein?p=1\">John Augenstein</a> had a 70 at Bandon Dunes. “Bogeyed three out of my last four coming in, so I played okay until then, just got to finish it off a little better”, said Ogletree. “Obviously playing [Bandon] Dunes [on Tuesday] in the afternoon, so it's going to be windy. But I've got to figure it out and just go post a good score and see what happens.”\r\n\r\n- Ogletree wasn't the only player to struggle coming in at Bandon Trails. The final four holes play straight into the strong north summer wind, and statistically played as the 1st, 5th, 2nd and 3rd hardest holes in relation to par.",

Ruffels was looking to defend her 2019 title and become just the 12th woman ever (and the fifth since World War II) to do so.

Picking up another win on the par-4 12th with a par, Zhang settled in nicely before losing the 18th to Ruffels to take a 1 up advantage into the second 18-holes.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter a brief lunch break, Ruffels kept the momentum gained on the 18th to win holes Nos. 20 and 21, bringing the match back into her favor at 1 up. Undeterred, Zhang regained the lead with sequential birdies as the pendulum swung back and forth.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“Winning those two holes was huge,” Zhang told the USGA. “That gave me a chance to recover after losing the previous two holes. It allowed me to regain the momentum.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nWinning the par-4 7th (25th hole), Ruffles brought the match back to a stalemate as the duo kept throwing darts onto the undulating and lightning-quick greens at Woodmont Country Club. Trading wins on holes 30 and 31, the match lived up to its billing as they remained tied through regulation.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nDown the stretch, momentum looked as though it was set to sway back in favor of Ruffels. Having been in the final match last year, she stayed poised despite mental errors and/or poor shots on the final four holes of regulation. Keeping pressure on Zhang, the 2017 Girls’ Junior PGA champion handled the applied pressure well. Having made mistakes of her own and her father calling her off of putts just as she was about to roll them, Zhang kept her composure, not allowing her opponent to ruffle her feathers.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMatching each other shot for shot despite their respective mistakes, Zhang gave Ruffels a break on the 36th hole to send the match to a playoff.<br><br>\r\n\r\nZhang hit the shot of the championship after flaring her drive to the left and failing to get her second shot into the fairway. With just under 100 yards to the pin, Zhang put a wedge inside 2-feet from the thick left rough.<br><br>\r\n\r\nRuffels conventionally made the green and had a 4-foot tester to force a playoff on her own merit, but Zhang gave her the nod to pick it up. A move that would leave a weekend warrior scratching their head, the gesture was highly respectful of Ruffels.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith both players unable to capitalize on open doors, they went to the par-4 8th for their 37th hole of the match.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter halving the 37th, the match became the longest championship match since 2001 when Merideth Duncan took the title over Nicole Perrot on the 37th hole.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBoth players had their third shots on the par-4 9th inside of 5-feet. Zhang was given the nod to pick her ball up but, with the championship on the line, Zhang refused to give Ruffels the 3-footer to continue the match.<br><br>\r\n\r\nRuffels’ ball was halfway down the cup before rimming out, costing her the opportunity to win back-to-back titles. The putt reminds the most avid of golf fans of the putt that <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/8490/Steven-Fox-stuns-Michael-Weaver-to-win-U-S--Am\">gave Steven Fox the 2012 U.S. Men’s Amateur</a> when Michael Weaver had a 5-footer hit a pebble on the 37th hole.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“You can’t take any putt for granted out here,” Ruffles said. “These greens are crazy fast, and that did have a little break to it. I was playing it outside of the hole. I actually hit it on my line, but it was heartbreaking to see it horseshoe out.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nFor Zhang, the championship gives her validation.<br><br> \r\n\r\n“Winning the U.S. Women’s Amateur means the world to me,” said Zhang. “To have my name on the trophy with the best players of all-time is life-changing for me. It’s a dream come true.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nRuffels, by virtue of her win last year, will be in the spotlight in December at the U.S. Women’s Open at Champions Club in Houston, Texas. She also earned an exemption into next year’s U.S. Women’s Open at Olympic Club in 2021. Zhang, with the win, will join Ruffels at Olympic Club next summer.",

The tall, burly Hokie pounds it a mile like we’re accustomed to seeing every week on the PGA Tour, but his distance does not come at a cost to his short game.\r\n\r\nDefeating 17-year-old David Stanford of Vienna, Virginia, 3&2 to claim the 107th Virginia State Golf Association Amateur Championship, Lawrence put all facets of his game on display.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe 36-hole championship match ebbed and flowed throughout the day, but Lawrence showed complete control of his game, and subsequently his opponent.\r\n\r\nCommanding a 3 up lead after the morning 18, Lawrence kept applying pressure, winning the 19th hole to take a 4 up lead. On No. 2 (hole 20), Lawrence found himself in some trouble with a delicate chip that was needed to save par and halve the hole to maintain the 4 up advantage.\r\n\r\n“I typically get talked about as a guy who hits it pretty far,” Lawrence told the VSGA. “But I work on my short game more than I work on anything else, and actually, what I feel is the best part of my game is my chipping. I have a lot of confidence in my wedges around the green, just because I’ve worked at it a lot.”\r\n\r\nHaving his work pay off, Lawrence saw the chip shot fall in for the halve.\r\n\r\nWith his lead cut in half thanks to wins by Stanford on Nos. 7 and 8, Lawrence found himself needing to rely on his wedge play to maintain momentum on the driveable par-4 12th. Blasting his drive into a greenside bunker, Lawrence got up and down from 12-feet to take a 3 up lead with just six to play.\r\n\r\nAfter Stanford left a putt one revolution short on No. 14 to win the hole and cut Lawrence’s lead to 2 up with four to play, Lawrence closed out the marathon match with par halves on Nos. 15 and 16 to win his home state title.\r\n\r\nLawrence made elite company, becoming just the fourth player in state history to win both the Virginia Amateur and the State Open, a feat that has not happened in 35 years.\r\n\r\nWith the Atlantic Coast Conference dropping the hammer on the fall golf season due to COVID-19, Lawrence is still trying to figure out his immediate future.\r\n\r\n“There’s no Q School until 2021,” Lawrence said. “As of right now, the Tech team is planning on playing in the spring, so I plan to play in the spring. Hopefully, I can play well enough in the spring that I can earn status through the PGA Tour University. If not that, it’s going to be Q School next year, it’s just a matter of whether or not they have China, Latinoamerica, Canada, those tours, before Q School. So, it’s sort of up in the air.”\r\n\r\nThe win marks Lawrence’s seventh VSGA title, good for 11th all-time.",

    "teaser": "The table is set for history to be made at Woodmont CC on Sunday between a defending champ and a high school senior",
    "articleText": "There have been 12 winners in the 120-year history of the U.S. Women’s Amateur to win consecutive titles. Seven past champs have won two in a row and five have gone on to win a remarkable three consecutive Robert Cox Cups.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nGabriella Ruffels has an opportunity to add her name to that list.\r\n\r\nBeginning the day with a match against AmateurGolf.com’s No. 1 ranked player, Emilia Migliaccio, Ruffels found herself in a familiar position; losing while standing on the ninth tee. 2 down to Micgliaccio, Ruffels bounced back with wins on Nos. 9 and 10 to bring the match back to all-square. The stalemate lasted through the par-4 14th when Migliaccio won the par-5 15th with a birdie to go 1 up. Ruffels countered with a win on the par-3 16th.\r\n\r\nMatching each other with pars on No. 17, the highly anticipated match came down to the 18th. Both Ruffels and Migliaccio were roughly equidistant on their approach shots. Migliaccio threw her second shot to roughly 40-feet, leaving the door open for Ruffels. Capitalizing on the opportunity, Ruffels put her second inside 10-feet.\r\n\r\nNeeding just one more putt to fall to have a chance, Migliaccio, who had her flat stick rolling throughout match play, singed the cup from deep for a conceded par. Ruffels knocked her birdie in to knock out the Wake Forest senior.\r\n\r\nAfter a 15-minute break, Ruffels faced 2-seed Valery Plata (Michigan State) who defeated Florida’s Kennedy Swann 1 up to advance to the semifinals.\r\n\r\nWasting no time, Ruffels took a 1 up lead on the second hole. Plata countered on the par-5 3rd and took a 1 up lead of her own on the par-5 5th, her lone lead of the match. Plata’s lead was shortlived as Ruffels brought the match back to all square on the 6th. Settling in nicely, Ruffels led for the first time all week as she stood on the ninth tee 1 up.\r\n\r\nThough 12 holes, Ruffels built upon her slim lead with a win on 13 which was immediately countered on 14 by Plata. Parring the par-3 16th for the second time on Saturday, she accrued a 2 up lead with just two to play. Plata, with her back to the wall, could only muster a halve of the par-4 17th, giving Ruffels a 2 up victory and her second-straight championship match appearance.\r\n\r\n“Winning the U.S. Women’s Amateur for the second time would mean everything,” Ruffels told the USGA. “I know the list of names that have won it twice and I’d love to join them. It’s the biggest tournament in women’s amateur golf and it would be an honor.”\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the bracket was Ruffels’ Southern California teammate Alyaa Abdulghany.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAbdulghany faced University of Virginia’s Riley Smyth in the quarterfinals, winning 2&1 to take on 17-year-old Rose Zhang in the semis. Zhang, a 2019 U.S. Girls' Junior Amateur quarterfinalist, secured her semifinals spot by beating Auburn’s Kaleigh Telfer 2&1 in the morning session.\r\n\r\nA Stanford verbal commit, Zhang played spoiler to an all-USC championship match, never letting Abdulghany take the lead over the course of the match. Jumping out to a 1 up lead through No. 1, Zhang built a 3 up lead on Abdulghany as the two made the turn at Woodmont Country Club.\r\n\r\nAbdulghany attempted to rally with wins on holes Nos. 11 and 12 to bring Zhang’s lead to just 1 up. Unable to gain any more ground through holes Nos. 13-16, Zhang capped the match with a birdie on the par-4 17th.\r\n\r\nThe soon to be high school senior has a tall task ahead of her on Sunday as she will face the defending U.S. Women’s Amateur champion. \r\n\r\n“It's surreal because I watched her win the Women's Amateur last year, and it just makes me feel so honored to play with her since she's such an amazing player and an amazing person,\" Zhang said. \"I'm just going to go out there and have fun tomorrow and try my best.”\r\n\r\nAs for Ruffels, she will use last year as a reminder to stay in the moment.\r\n\r\n“I feel like it's the same, very similar to last year,\" Ruffels said. \"I’ll definitely draw on that experience. This championship is so crazy, with mixed emotions all the time. It’s like a roller coaster. I'm just so happy right now.”\r\n\r\nBy advancing to the championship match, both players gained exemptions into the 2021 U.S. Women's Open at Olympic Club.\r\n\r\nThe 36-hole championship match will be broadcasted on Golf Channel beginning at 1:00 pm ET.",

    "articleText": "Save (par) Ferris.\r\n\r\nEight shots behind the leader, Chris Kovach, heading into the final round of the 30th Metropolitan Amateur Championship, Christopher Ferris sat in an ever distant second place.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nKovach tore apart Meadowbrook Country Club in Ballwin, Missouri on Friday. Tallying 13 birdies and five bogeys over his first 36-holes, Kovach tied the tournament’s 36-hole scoring record but could not keep his remarkable pace on Saturday, posting a 4-over 76.\r\n\r\nEnter Christopher Ferris.\r\n\r\nAfter an opening 70 and a second-round 74, the University of Missouri-St. Louis senior was even-par but far from Kovach. Plodding his way around the course, Ferris was on fire as the two made the turn. Closing the front nine out with four birdies on hole Nos. 5-8, he gained six shots on Kovach.\r\n\r\n“I just went out and played my game,\" Ferris told the MAGA. \"I knew the front 9 was my 9 and played the front in 6-under the first two days, if I played it in 3-under it would make it a match on the back 9.\"\r\n\r\nOut in 31, Ferris mellowed out on the back-nine needing to make up three shots as they stood on the 15th tee. Carding birdies on Nos. 15 and 17, while Kovach dropped a shot on the par-3 17th the duo were tied on the 18th tee.\r\n\r\nWith the pressure cooker on high, Kovach could not capitalize on the championship as he made a double-bogey six to Ferris’ par, essentially handing the trophy to Ferris.\r\n\r\nWithout a doubt, Ferris won the event rather than Kovach losing it. Applying the pressure when it mattered most, he capped off the summer with a remarkable final round 66.",

    "articleText": "A long and grueling day was in store for those who earned a spot into the Round of 32. After Hurricane Isaias washed out Tuesday, the USGA had to adjust the match play rounds to accommodate the championship weekend.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter two rounds of matches on Friday, eight women remain in the hunt for the 120th U.S. Women's Amateur Championship at Woodmont Country Club. Here they are:<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18164/Gabriela-Ruffels?p=1\">Gabriela Ruffels</a> (Australia)<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/rankings/18164.jpg\"></div></div>The 2019 U.S Women’s Amateur champion must feel comfortable when faced with adversity. Gabriela Ruffels has been down in all three of her matches this week when standing on the ninth tee box. All three times she has mounted a comeback to keep her title defense alive.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I've been down in all of my matches, but No. 9 has been a big turning point for me,” Ruffels told the USGA. “If I can be close heading to the back nine, then I feel like I have an advantage.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nAdvancing farther than any defending champ since Danielle Kang in 2011, Ruffels took down the 2019 U.S. Girls’ Junior champion Lei Ye 2 up in the morning session and Teresa Toscano Borrero 4&2 in the afternoon session to punch her ticket to the Elite Eight.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe USC Trojan will face Golfweek/AmateurGolf.com’s No. 1 ranked woman Emilia Migliaccio in the quarterfinals.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18886/Emilia-Migliaccio?p=1\">Emilia Migliaccio</a> (Cary, N.C.)<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/rankings/18886.jpg\"></div></div>Boasting a 17-1-1 match play record in ranked events since 2017, Wake Forest’s Emilia Migliaccio came into the week as a favorite to claim her first USGA title.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSquaring off against 30-seed Amari Avery, Migliaccio made easy work to advance to the Round of 16 with a 3&2 win. However, Auburn’s Megan Schofill gave Migliaccio a run for her money, nearly giving her her second match play loss in over three years.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, it was best for Migliaccio that she put Avery away when she did. All square with Schofill on the 18th, Schofill nearly holed out from 150 yards, leading to a conceded birdie. With a 15-foot putt separating Migliaccio from a plane ride home or a chance to continue her run, she nailed the putt which was capitalized with a huge fist pump and a wave of momentum.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter a near-miss birdie from four feet on the 21st hole to win the match, Migliaccio rallied on the 22nd with yet another 15-foot putt to clinch her spot in the quarterfinals.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I'm just so happy,” said Migliaccio. “This is the first time I've ever been in extra holes in match play. I really want this thing, so I really fought for it.” Her marathon day will be rewarded with a 7:30 am ET match against the defending champ, Gabriela Ruffels.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/23730/Rose-Zhang?p=1\">Rose Zhang</a> (Irvine, Calif.)<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt has been almost three decades since the stroke-play medalist has also has won the U.S. Women’s Amateur. That streak continued Friday as 16-seed Rose Zhang defeated Rachel Heck in the Round of 16. Zhang won her Round of 32 match over Maria Bohorquez 2 up as Heck took care of 32-seed Cecilie Finne-Ipsen 4&3.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe duo duked it out over the course of the round with Zhang landing the knockout punch on No. 18.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTaking out the No. 1 seed without her “A-game”, Zhang was still able to claw her back from 2 down at the turn.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I just had to stick in there mentally. I was 2 down at the turn. I just thought about doing whatever it takes to put the ball in play and give myself some chances.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nZhang faces 24-seed Kaleigh Telfer at 7:00 am ET on Saturday.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/23871/Kaleigh-Telfer?p=1\">Kaleigh Telfer</a> (South Africa)<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the second Auburn-Wake Forest match of the day (Migliaccio v Schofill), South African native Kaleigh Telfer helped the Tigers split bragging rights with the Demon Deacons.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBeating Emily Mahar in the Round of 32, Telfer was tasked with facing arguably the hottest amateur golfer on the planet in Rachel Kuehn. Coming off of back-to-back wins at the Women’s North & South as well as the LNGA Championship, Kuehn was maintaining her torrid pace at Woodmont Country Club.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTelfer won the match 2&1 by applying consistent pressure and jumping out to an early lead, not allowing Kuehn to gain any momentum.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Auburn senior will continue her quest against Rose Zhang in the Elite Eight.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/87745/Alyaa-Abdulghany\">Alyaa Abdulghany</a> (Newport Beach, Calif.)<br><br>\r\n\r\nMalaysian born Alyaa Abdulghany won her morning match 4&2 over Marissa Kirkwood en route to squaring off with 29-seed Ellie Slama. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe duo had a back and forth battle that had six lead changes. The last and most important lead change came on the 14th hole when Abdulghany tied the match with a par. All square through No. 16, Abdulghany iced the match with back-to-back birdies on holes Nos. 17 and 18 to advance.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAbdulghany will face 5-seed Riley Smyth for the first half of Saturday’s play.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/25614/Riley-Smyth?p=1\">Riley Smyth</a> (Cary, N.C.)<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Virginia Cavalier needed 39 holes to advance to Saturday. After beating Addie Baggarly 1 up in the morning session, Smyth was entangled in a 21 hole marathon battle against 53-seed Lauren Beaudreau.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBeaudreau, who held a 2 up lead three times throughout the round, lost her final two-hole advantage on the par-3 16th. Smyth knocked in a birdie on No. 16 and a par No. 17 to square the match heading to the 18th. The pair stayed deadlocked until Smyth birdied the par-5 4th (hole 21) to secure her spot against Abdulghany.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/25297/Valery-Plata?p=1\">Valery Plata</a> (Colombia)<br><br>\r\n\r\nColombian native Valery Plata began her day as one of six single-digit seeds. With Heck making her exit in the Round of 16, Plata is the highest-seeded player remaining in the championship.<br><br>\r\n\r\nDefeating Zoe Antoinette Campos 2 up in the morning, Plata made quick work of Tyler Akabane. Commanding a 3 up lead through the first three holes, Plata took that lead through the turn.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNever letting Akabane get closer than 2 down, Plata locked herself into the Elite Eight after halving the 16th with Akabane for a 3&2 victory.<br><br>\r\n\r\nPlata will face 23-seed Kennedy Swann to kick-off her Saturday.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/19766/Kennedy-Swann?p=1\">Kennedy Swann</a> (Austin, Texas)<br><br>\r\n\r\nOle Miss fifth-year senior Kennedy Swann stayed consistent in her two wins on Friday. Defeating Bohyun Park 2&1 Friday morning, Swann did the same against Oklahoma State’s Isabella Fierro.<br><br>\r\n\r\nA back and forth battle that featured three lead changes, Fierro and Swann never let each other out of their crosshairs. Swann managed to grab a 1 up lead through No. 9 after being 2 down No. 2 and 1 down after No. 6.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSwann maintained her 1 up lead through No. 12 before Fierro knotted the match up on No. 13.

    "articleText": "Kokomo, Indiana native Tim Miller began the final round of the Indiana Golf Association Senior Amateur Championship four shots off the lead. Two groups ahead of the overnight leader Steve Norris (Carmel, Indiana), Miller used home-course advantage to mount a comeback effort.\r\n\r\nShooting two-shots better than his age during Thursday’s first round, Miller was 1-over carding a 71. Coming back on Friday, Miller used six birdies and one bogey to post a 5-under 65, good for the low round of the tournament.\r\n\r\n“I’m 73 years old, so I played pretty well for me,” Miller told the IGA.  “I wasn’t too happy yesterday, but was proud of how I played today.\"\r\n\r\nAs a member of Kokomo Country Club in Kokomo, Indiana, Miller without a doubt used his local knowledge to carve five birdies into his scorecard.\r\n\r\n“It makes it a little easier playing at home,” Miller said.  “You know where the ball is supposed to be and it definitely helps with reading the greens a little better.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nMiller did just enough to keep a surging Bob Jacobs (Valparaiso, Indiana) at arms-length. Jacobs, in the final group, was tied with Miller to begin the final round. Besting his first-round score by five shots, Jacobs carded a 66 to finish at 3-under for the tournament and one shot back of Miller.\r\n\r\nThe win marks the third time Miller has hoisted the IGA senior amateur trophy. He was back-to-back titles in 2004 and 2005.\r\n\r\n“It’s very gratifying because I haven’t been playing in tournaments for a long time, so I was surprised,” said Miller.  “It’s a lot of fun playing competitively because I’ve known these guys for years.”\r\n\r\nJerry McMullen took home the super senior title with a 5-over 145, to win by two over Greg McCall.",

    "articleText": "By <a href=\"https://www.unionleader.com/sports/golf/her-wedding-postponed-by-pandemic-watt-finds-something-to-celebrate/article_333d4a6c-4cbc-501f-be4f-f13c0c269d31.html\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Hall New Hampshire Union Leader</a>\r\n\r\nTara Watt postponed her wedding this summer but celebrated another special moment Wednesday at Bretwood Golf Course.\r\n\r\nThe 37-year-old Derryfield Country Club member and Manchester resident won the New Hampshire Women’s Golf Association Amateur Championship for the second time, shooting a 7-over 223 over the 54-hole, stroke play tournament.\r\n\r\nWatt, who won the 2011 State Am at The Golf Club of New England in Stratham, planned to skip the tournament this year. She was supposed to get married on June 26 at Josiah’s Meetinghouse in Epping but rescheduled the wedding to next year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With an unexpected week’s worth of vacation time available, Watt entered the State Am on the second-to-last day of registration.\r\n\r\n“I was like, ‘What else am I going to do?’” Watt said. “We’re quarantined and can’t go anywhere, so might as well go play golf.”\r\n\r\nWatt, who had not played Bretwood since her high school career at Kennett of Conway, shot a 2-over 74 on Wednesday after posting a 76 on Monday and a 73 on Tuesday. She entered Wednesday tied with Atkinson Resort and CC member Barb Hecimovich for second place, as both were a stroke behind Intervale CC member Johnna Lorry.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHecimovich and Lorry, who both played alongside Watt on Wednesday, shared runner-up honors after both finished at 10-over 226. Lorry posted the lowest round of the tournament with her 1-under 71 on Monday. The runner-up finish was a career-best in the State Am for both Lorry, 36, and Hecimovich, 58.\r\n\r\nWatt said she adjusted her game and hit irons off every tee box because the 6,976-yard course was playing extremely short.\r\n\r\n“(Wednesday), I was just going to come out here and try to make 18 pars and I knew that would probably be good to stand out,” Watt said. “I didn’t do that but it still worked out.”\r\n\r\nWatt sunk a long-range putt to eagle No. 5, bogeyed No. 9 and No. 10, posted a double bogey on No. 15 and parred the rest of the course. The Southern New Hampshire University assistant women’s golf coach had a two-stroke lead at the turn and was 4-up after 14 holes.\r\n\r\nAfter Watt sunk her putt to make par on the final hole, she jumped in excitement and proclaimed that she was no longer a “one-and-done” winner.\r\n\r\n“I think that that eagle that I made on five was a huge momentum booster and I hit a driver and a wedge — that’s not normal to make an eagle,” Watt said. “But I made a bomb of a putt and that just kind of got me going and I was just real focused and just trying to hit fairways and greens and make some putts.”\r\n\r\nLorry, who is from Manchester and now lives in Bedford, said she hit good approach shots and made putts over the first two days of the tournament, which allowed her to lead after both rounds. Lorry, who said she plays golf only about 6-10 times a year, birdied on the third and fifth holes on Wednesday.\r\n\r\n“The bad shots were a little worse (Wednesday) and I had to scramble around to get to where I needed to be but being 6-over (Wednesday) is right where I usually play,” said Lorry, who has played in the State Am six times.\r\n\r\nHecimovich, of Hamilton, Mass., double bogeyed No. 3, which she said she knew would be hard to come back from.\r\n\r\nIntervale CC member and 15-year-old Eva Gonzales placed fourth with a 12-over 228. Abenaqui CC member and 16-time State Am champion Dana Harrity took fifth with a 13-over 229. Gonzales, a soon-to-be sophomore at Nashua High School North, shot a 74 and Harrity shot a 79 on Wednesday.",

    "teaser": "Rider University senior grinds his way to win despite a lack of confidence on the greens",
    "articleText": "Rider University senior Austin Devereux began the final round of the 119th New Jersey State Golf Association Amateur in third place, just two shots back of the 54-hole leader. \r\n\r\nMaking his debut in the event, Devereux was coming off a T-30 finish at the NJSGA Open two weeks ago where he competed against amateurs and pros alike. Devereux's brother, Max, won the Amateur back in 2015, giving Austin the opportunity to make history as the only set of brothers to win the NJSGA Amateur.\r\n\r\nPaired with NJSGA junior champion Dean Greyserman in the second-to-last group, the two duked it out for the title as overnight leaders Chris Dejohn and Brendan Hansen stumbled from their perch with 18 holes separating them from a win. Greyserman, who shot a tournament-low 67 in the first round, kept Devereux focused and on edge throughout the day.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“That 40-footer on top of Dean’s chip-in really got my confidence going,” Devereux told the NJSGA. “The biggest thing for me this week was putting. I had one three-putt all week. The funny thing is, putting was always my biggest weakness.”\r\n\r\nPosting a front nine 35 (-1), Devereux kept things rolling on the back nine as he birdied three of his first five holes after making the turn. Despite having issues with the short stick, Devereux had a gameplan and executed it to near perfection.\r\n\r\n“I said coming into today that I wanted to hit fairways and give myself some looks,” Devereux said.  “So today, I hit 12 fairways and 16 greens. My birdie looks were all inside 20 feet and I made a lot of 10-footers. After the front nine, I decided to get aggressive. You had to be aggressive here, especially where the pins were located.”\r\n\r\nFollowing a birdie on the par-3 14th, he logged a two-stroke lead over Greyserman. Gaining another shot over Greyserman after he bogeyed the par-5 15th, Devereux cruised to the 18th tee. Leaving a bit of drama, Devereux carded a bogey for a final round 69 and a 282 (-6) total.\r\n\r\n“I’ve taken my game to another level this summer,” said Devereux. “I’m much more confident.”\r\n\r\n2019 champion Mark Costanza came up short in his efforts to defend. He finished in solo third at 3-under (285). 54-hole co-leader Chris Dejohn tied for sixth at 1-under (287) alongside Ethan Ng. Fellow 54-hole leader Brendan Hansen carded a final round 74 to finish in a tie for fourth with Ryan Lee at 2-under (286).",

    "teaser": "Liberty senior ends his summer on a high note thanks to a missed gimme putt",
    "articleText": "Coming into the summer, Liberty senior Zach Barbin was trying to simply find a win.\r\n\r\nHe found two.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nBarbin bested Gregor Orlando and Jeff Osberg in a four-hole aggregate at the 118th Joseph H.  Patterson Cup held by the Golf Association of Philadelphia. After picking up his first GAP major earlier this summer at the BMW Philadelphia Amateur Championship, Barbin becomes the first player to win both events since 1995.\r\n\r\n“To say you are going to win the Philly Amateur and Patterson Cup [in the same year], that’s ridiculous,” Barbin told GAP. “I came in second in stroke-play qualifying for the amateur at Stonewall in 2019 and that was kind of the point I realized I could actually play with these guys. I still can’t believe [I won]. I’m pretty stunned.”\r\n\r\nThe disbelief was justified. Osberg, who was looking to defend his 2019 title, missed a two-foot par putt on the fourth playoff hole to match Barbin’s aggregate score.\r\n\r\n“I’m really not that upset,” the 36-year-old mid-am said. “I feel like I hit a good putt. I don’t know what to say about it. I tapped down all the marks that were there… For that not to go in is devastating.”\r\n\r\nThanks to Hurricane Isaias the Patterson Cup was cut from 36 to 18 holes after Tuesday’s round was washed out. The mad-dash set up the three-way playoff between Barbin, Osberg, and Orlando who all finished at 3-under (67). Both Barbin and Osberg closed their rounds with bogeys, missing an opportunity to claim the title in regulation.\r\n\r\nAfter three playoff holes, Barbin and Osberg separated themselves from Orlando by two shots as the trio made their way to 18. Osberg found the fairway while Barbin bombed one into the first cut on the right side. First, to play out of the two, Osberg pulled a 9-iron left of the pin to 35-feet. Barbin answered with a pitching wedge over a tree from 157 yards. He sat 20-feet right of the hole, pin-high.\r\n\r\nLagging his birdie putt to a knee-knocking four-feet, Barbin was in for par.\r\n\r\n“That putt coming back was really hard. I can’t believe I made it,” said Barbin. “It’s tough to win that way. Jeff and Gregor were playing great. You want to beat the person to win, not have the guy make a mistake like that. It was a shame.”",

    "articleText": "Neither COVID-19 nor Hurricane Isaias could keep the 120th U.S. Women's Amateur from being played. The USGA elected to take Tuesday off to allow Hurricane Isaias to pass as the course took on nearly 3-inches of rain.\r\n\r\nStanford signee Rachel Heck snagged medalist honors following a hurricane-delayed second round at the U.S. Women’s Amateur.\r\n\r\n“I slept in super late,\" Heck told the USGA when asked how she spent the day off. \"I ate some food. I took another nap. I ate some more food. That's about how it went. It was pretty nice.” \r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe day off on Tuesday was a blessing in disguise for AG's No. 2 ranked player in the world and defending champion Gabriela Ruffels (Southern California).\r\n\r\n“I actually had two finals,\" Ruffels said. \"I'm taking two summer school classes. It worked out perfect that it was a day off because I could focus on my finals.\"\r\n\r\nWith her finals behind her, Ruffels made a run at medalist honors finishing tied for fifth at 1-under.\r\n\r\nHeck, who trailed red-hot Rachel Kuehn (Wake Forest) and Riley Smyth (Auburn) by a single shot following Monday’s first round had to wait an extra 24 hours to secure the top-seed and medalist honors at Woodmont Country Club.\r\n\r\nAs per usual with USGA championships, Woodmont was playing tough. However, when conditions are toughest, a simplistic approach is usually best.\r\n\r\n“It’s pretty tight, so we were focusing on hitting fairways, hitting greens, not trying to do anything crazy,\" said Heck. \"That's kind of been my game plan and it’s worked out well so far.”\r\n\r\nThe Memphis native built upon her opening 3-under 69 with a 1-under 71 as she was able to survive a turbulent 18. Heck posted four bogeys that were canceled out with five birdies throughout the day. Finishing the 36-hole stroke play portion at 4-under, Heck grabs the No. 1 overall seed as the event flips the page to match play.\r\n\r\nBoth Kuehn and Smyth carded rounds over par while still maintaining top-10 finishes, easily making match play.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of match play, the field was cut from 132 to 64 to set the bracket that will lead to a champion being crowned on Sunday in a 36-hole marathon. AG No. 1 Emilia Migliaccio (Wake Forest) flirted with medalist honors as well coming up two-shots short of Heck at 2-under.\r\n\r\nA record-tying 15-player playoff settled the final six spots of the 64-player bracket as 15 players came in on the 6-over cut line (2015; 16 for 10). Needing just two holes to sort out the qualifiers, the field is officially set for match play. The field will be cut in half to 32 on Thursday.\r\n\r\nPlayoff qualifiers: Kajal Mistry (Arkansas); Haylin Harris (Michigan State); Gurleen Kaur (Baylor); Therese Warner (Arizona); Auston Kim (Vanderbilt); Katherine Zhu (Pepperdine)",

At 14-years-old, Chien is no stranger to elite competition. Winning the AJGA’s KPMG Stacy Lewis Junior All-Star Invitational in both 2019, and 2020, Chien earned herself Symetra Tour starts with each win.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nFast forward to this week and it was business as usual for Chien. Kicking off the tournament with a 1-over 72, she was six-shots off the lead heading into Tuesday’s second round. Chien got hot early as she was 5-under through six holes. Cooling off, Chien finished the rest of her round at 1-over as she carded a 4-under 67 to climb the leaderboard.\r\n\r\nSleeping on a 1-shot lead, Chien kept the momentum going on Wednesday. Matching her front nine Tuesday score of 32, she had a more colorful back nine as the event came to a close. Extending her lead to six shots after the opening nine, Chien kept it steady as she traded three birdies and two bogeys for a 5-under 66 and an 8-under, 205 total.\r\n\r\nChien’s nearest competitor was 2019 U.S. Women’s Amateur Round of 64 finalist Madelyn Gamble. Gamble posted rounds of 72-72-68 (212) to be Chien’s closest competition and only other golfer under par.\r\n\r\nCal-Berkley’s Eun Soo Jeon and Boston College’s Bibilani Liu both finished at even-par in a tie for third.\r\n\r\nIt is without a doubt that no moment is too big for Chien. The rising star will be a name we will be seeing atop major leaderboards in no time.",

    "articleText": "Finally.\r\n\r\nAfter a month stretch of coming up on the short end, mid-am Nick Maccario comes through at the 56th Hornblower Amateur.\r\n\r\nThe golf gods swayed against Maccario at the Massachusetts Amateur, the New England Amateur, and the Francis Ouimet Memorial before giving him the nod this week.\r\n\r\n“Everybody has their week,” Maccario told AmateurGolf.com. “You just have to wait until it’s yours.”\r\n\r\nHappy he played well over the course of July, Maccario could not ignore the mental toll his close calls took on him.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“You need luck to win a golf tournament or at least a couple bounces,” Maccario said.“Not to say that you earn them or anything but there’s definitely a couple of times where I felt that my opponents got good breaks and I’d hit a couple of bad shots, so it’s a little bit of that luck factor.”\r\n\r\nHe found that luck on Tuesday at Plymouth Country Club. Heading into the second round of the 36-hole tournament, Maccario was six shots off the lead after posting an even-par 69. Battling harsh winds that were coming off the front edge of Hurricane Isaias, Maccario was 3-under on the day and was thinking he needed a par to at least tie round one leader Chris Francouer who was, at the time, 3-over on the day.\r\n\r\n“I felt pretty calm,” said Maccario. “The last shot I hit into 18 was a 90-yard shot, I couldn’t go at the pin I was coming out of the rough and it was downwind 30 miles per hour. I aimed just on the front edge and I just carried the bunker by a foot, it bounced up and got to the green about 20-feet [from the hole]. I was like ‘that’s the bounce I needed’... it was a good bounce that went my way.”\r\n\r\nJotting down a par to close things out, Maccario finally got the proverbial camel off his back. Francouer finished his round at 4-over (2-under for the tournament), finishing in a tie for second with Max Ferrari.\r\n\r\nWith the win, Maccario is looking forward to taking some much needed time off from competitive golf. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a more dominant stretch of golf this summer than the one Maccario put together.",

    "teaser": "Defending a streak of his own, Chestnut grabs his first GAM win in over a decade",
    "articleText": "12 years separate the bookends of Jimmy Chestnut’s wins at the Golf Association of Michigan Championship.\r\n\r\nThe 38-year-old attorney from Royal Oak, Michigan rallied down the stretch as Ann Arbor native Tyler Copp faltered in Tuesday’s final round.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“I’ve won the Michigan Amateur and the GAM, and now the GAM again and to win three of the big GAM events is a big deal for me,” Chestnut told GAM’s, Greg Johnson. “It kicks me up a notch, I guess to another level in my mind, and to do it 12 years later is special.”\r\n\r\nAs the last golfer to win both the GAM and the Michigan Amateur in the same year (2008), Chestnut kept the draught going. Copp, a soon-to-be senior at Mercer (Georgia), took home the Michigan Amateur earlier this summer. Coming into the final round, Copp looked as though he would become the ninth golfer in the 99-year history of both events to sweep the pair in the same season.\r\n\r\nTaking a one-shot lead into the third and final round, Copp was cruising uneventfully through the front nine, tallying a bogey and birdie on Nos. 8 and 9 to close out the front for a 1-under 34. Unfortunately for Copp, three bogeys on the first four holes of the back nine gave Chestnut all the room he needed to snag the lead.\r\n\r\n Chestnut was one shot worse on the front side posting an even-par 35. As he began the day 4-shots back of Copp, the attorney began playing the role of both the prosecutor and the defendant. \r\n\r\n“I knew I was the last one to do it and when Tyler was a 9-under and I was at 5-under and four back, I started thinking it was his turn [to win]”, Chestnut said. “But then things changed, all of a sudden in a few holes we were tied and in entered my mind again that I could stop the double and still be the last guy to do it, which is kind of cool.”\r\n\r\nCopp did not go down without a little bit of drama as he had a tying 20-foot birdie putt come up one revolution short of the bottom of the cup on the 18th green.\r\n\r\n“I’m not going to be too hung up about it,” Copp said. “The Michigan Am was the one tournament I wanted to win this summer, so this was just icing on the cake, or could have been.”\r\n\r\nA familiar face finished third behind the pair. Michigan State’s James Piot lost the championship match to Copp at the Michigan Amateur. After bringing his “D-game” on Tuesday, Pilot carded a 71 to finish third at 5-under.\r\n\r\nWith over a decade past since his last big win, Chestnut was reassured that he was very much alive as he came down the stretch.\r\n\r\n“I got a break having an open shot on 18 to the green, and then I was able to two-putt with the nerves going,” he said. “That last three-footer was tough. I was lucky it found the bottom of the cup. It was really fun to be the mix, to be right there again with the nerves and it feels great to have pulled it off.”",

Among those in the morning wave was defending champion Gabriela Ruffels (USC). Paired with red hot North & South winner Rachel Kuehn (Wake Forest) and Western winner Brigitte Thibault (Fresno State), Ruffles stayed steady as she carded an even-par 72.\r\n\r\n“There was extra pressure, extra nerves, especially with the whole year that's been going on,” Ruffels told the USGA. “It's been a long wait to get here, but I'm happy with how I did today and how I handled those first-round nerves.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nKuehn kept her torrid pace as she holds a share lead following the first round. Posting a 4-under 68, Kuehn knocked home six birdies and two bogeys to hold a two-way split as the field gets ready for the final 18 holes of medal play. Coming off of back-to-back major wins (North & South and the LNGA), Kuehn will definitely be one to keep our eyes on as the week progresses.\r\n\r\n“I feel in control over the golf ball,” Kuehn said. “It's just a confidence thing, and I'm putting pretty well right now. I've been glad to be able to put myself in position to make some birdies and then being able to convert some of those.”\r\n\r\nSitting atop the leaderboard with Kuehn is Riley Smyth (Virginia). Smyth was bogey-free until the par-3 14th where she dropped a shot. Gaining it back on the par-4 17th, she is in prime position with 18-holes remaining before the event flips to match-play.\r\n\r\nBoth Kuehn and Smyth are North Carolina natives and playing in their first U.S. Women's Amateur. Rookies make up about 40% of the field, but do not let that be confused with poor play. Kuehn and Smyth are just two examples of elite players in the event that just so happen to be making their debut.\r\n\r\nThe second round, originally scheduled for Tuesday, will be postponed until Wednesday as weather from Isaias forcing a long rain delay Monday.\r\n\r\nWith the conclusion of play on Wednesday, the field will be cut to 64 and the format will switch over to match-play. Further schedule details will be released at a later time.",

Picking up two more wins (3&2, 1 up) the stage was set for the duo on Sunday.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe 36-hole marathon had plenty of parody with three lead changes. Wall pounced early, taking a 2 up lead through No. 5. Sample countered quickly with wins on holes 6, 7, and 9 to give himself a 1 up advantage at the quarter mark.\r\n\r\nSample would continue to press after a four-hole stalemate to kick off the first back nine. 3 down through 17, Wall began his comeback. \r\n\r\n“I really liked the way I started, just consistent to start off right out of the gate,” Wall told the Metropolitan Golf Association. “I just made some solid pars and got my bearings, but then Luke really made a push over the last 13 holes [of the morning].”\r\n\r\nWinning the 18th hole before the break, Wall went to work on the second 18. \r\n\r\nHe won the 22nd, and 23rd holes of the match to get it back to all square as the duo stood on the 24th tee. 2-up through 29, Wall began to put the match away with wins on holes 30, 32, and 34 en route to the 4&2 win.\r\n\r\n“I think getting it back to 2 really gave me some confidence to come back out here and work hard and try and get it back,” Wall said.\r\n\r\nSample was a pesky out all week. He battled through a nine-hole playoff following the stroke-play round to earn the 16th and final spot before making his remarkable run to the championship match at Bethpage Black. Because of the run made by Sample, Wall can cherish his win a bit more.\r\n\r\n“I think this one definitely means the most and is the biggest just because it’s such a great field of great amateurs in our area so I would rank it on the top of the list for sure,” said Wall. “Especially to do it here at Bethpage Black which has so much history and so many great winners like Brooks Koepka and all of them, it’s truly amazing and I’m very blessed to have done it here.” Thursday was the first time that Wall played the course, saying he sometimes plays better going into a course blind because he doesn't think of all the possible trouble. He fired a 1-over 72 on Thursday, taking the No. 15 seed into match play and on to victory.”",

    "articleText": "One-shot off the 54-hole leader, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/16644/Colin-Prater?p=1\">Colin Prater</a> overcome’s the deficit to win at the 84th Colorado Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\nPrater, a former champ himself, chased down 2019 champ, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/23965/Davis-Bryant?p=1\">Davis Bryant</a> to claim the title. Beginning the day at 10-under and 9-under respectively, Prater carded a 4-under 66 to Bryant’s 1-over 71 to win by six shots. After Bryant three-putted the first hole, Prater took a share of the lead and ran with it.\r\n\r\nWith the win, Prater becomes the first competitor in 11 years to win both the CGA stroke and match play events (<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/1116/Steve-Ziegler?p=1\">Steve Ziegler</a>, 2009). Add in the fact that Prater was also the low-am at the Colorado Open and he has himself a ‘Colorado Triple Crown’.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nPrater is the first to be low-am at the Colorado Open and win both amateur titles since Gary Longfellow did it in 1974, the first mid-am to win the stroke play championship since Jonathan Marsico in 2008. The six-stroke victory was the largest margin of victory since 2003 when Kane Webber won by seven.\r\n\r\n“I drove it really solid all week and that’s one of the first things out here that you need to do — and that maybe is a touch underrated,” Prater told the Colorado Golf Association. “Besides hitting the tee ball in the bunker (on 9), I never really had a poor tee-ball all week. I might have missed four or five fairways all week. Other than that I drove it really solid. That gave me a clean ball into the green. Then if I was able to control my iron shots, I’d give myself a good look at a birdie.”\r\n\r\nAs for how special his win was in the record books?\r\n\r\n“It hasn’t sunk in yet, but it’s cool,” he said. “I’m super fortunate. I started playing well to start the summer. The swing has felt solid and I feel like I’m getting better.”\r\n\r\nAll in all, the 25-year-old high school science teacher and golf coach has had quite the summer vacation.\r\n\r\nAs for Bryant, he’ll lick his wounds before heading west to compete in the U.S. Amateur at Bandon Dunes.",

    "articleText": "NC State freshman <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/27922/Nicholas-Mathews?p=1\">Nicholas Mathews</a> duked it out against East Carolina senior <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21554/Tim-Bunten?p=1\">Tim Bunten</a> for the 11th annual North Carolina Amateur Match Play Championship.\r\n\r\nMathews and Bunten had similar paths to the championship match. As the 18-seed, Mathews went 5&4, 2&1, 2 up, and 5&4 on his way through the lower half of the bracket. His biggest upset came in the second round as Mathews defeated 2-seeded Austin Bonfiglio 5&4.\r\n\r\nBunten, the 29-seed in the 32-man match-play event, opened the Round of 32 with a 2&1 win over 4-seed Garrett Risner. Following the upset with 1 up, 4&3, and 3&2 wins on his way to facing Mathews.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nIn Sunday’s championship match Mathews never trailed and allowed Bunten just three wins throughout the match. Kicking things off with a par on the first, Mathews took a 1 up advantage early. Alternating wins with Bunten on holes 2 and 3, Mathews grew upon his lead with three wins over holes 4 through 7. Taking a 4 up lead over Bunten into the backside, Mathews let him back into the match. \r\n\r\nBunten chipped away with wins on holes 10, 14, and 16 while earning halves on five of the last seven holes to get Mathews’ lead to just 1 up with two to play.\r\n\r\n“I just did a great job staying focused, staying calm, and just trusting my game plan and fortunately it worked out,” Mathews told the Carolinas Golf Association. “Going into No. 17 I had a one-up lead and I just knew I needed to stay calm and keep doing what I was doing.”\r\n\r\nHe executed just as he had visualized making a par on the par-5 17th to claim a 2&1 victory.\r\n\r\n“Anytime you get it done, and frankly anytime you play well coming down the stretch it’s always momentum and that momentum keeps you working hard,” Mathews said. “It’s something you call back on in times of pressure. I think it’s just validation that I’m doing the right stuff and it's just a matter of continuing to work hard and continuing to focus on what I need to do.” \r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Mathews, that momentum will have to wait to be unleashed as the ACC announced last week that men’s and women’s golf will have to forego their fall seasons due to COVID-19. The earliest Mathews can hit the links for the Wolfpack will (hopefully) come in the spring of 2021.",

    "articleText": "Carrollton’s Serena Shah, an SMU Junior, outlasted the field at the Texas Women’s stroke play championship. Battling tough conditions at Crown Colony Country Club, Shah posted rounds of 76-71-77 (224) to clear her competition by a single shot. \r\n\r\nStaying near the top of the leaderboard all week, Shah slept on the lead Friday as the event went into its final round. Carding a 77 on Saturday, Shah had a simple game plan heading into the championship round.\r\n\r\n“This is a really tough course and it’s tight off the fairway, so just going in with the same mentality I did from the practice round to the first round to the second round was just to keep things simple,” Shah told the TGA. “Hit the fairway, hit the green and two-putt from there.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAfter completing the remaining four holes of the second round due to weather on Friday, Shah got to work on the final 18 holes.\r\n\r\nNot able to get much going, Shah kept the damage to a minimum with a front side 2-over 38. Making the turn, that’s when Shah made things interesting. Beginning on No. 9, Shah made four-straight bogeys to put herself at 5-over on the day. Tacking another bogey on No. 15, Shah scrambled to close her final three holes at 1-under-par.\r\n\r\n“Everything was going pretty well on the front nine and then on the back nine I had a little trouble,” Shah said. “I had a couple bogeys on 10, 11 and 12 and then I think the real turning point was on 16 where I had a birdie putt that I made from 8 feet, and that just kind of helped with my momentum going into the last 2 holes. I think that really helped just finish off the last three holes in a good style.”\r\n\r\nThe birdie on No. 16 proved to be the difference-maker as Zoe Paige Slaughter posted a 73 to finish at 9-over for the event, one shot off of Shah’s pace.\r\n\r\nJennie Park (+11) took solo third. Nicole Viver (+14) finished in solo fourth and Brooke Nolte took home a solo fifth-place finish at 15-over.",

Carding rounds of 69-66-64-65 (-24), Sargent shattered the tournament scoring record by six shots (264). The previous scoring record of 270 was set back in 2018 by Matt Lorenz at Pine Tree Country Club.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAt 17-years-old Sargent is the youngest winner of the even in the modern era. After holing 10 birdies and making two of his four bogeys on the week en route to a third-round 64, he took a four-stroke lead into Saturday’s final round at Saughahatchee Country Club over Alabama-Birmingham’s Drew Mathers.\r\n\r\nMaybe more impressive than Sargent’s performance this week was the depth of the Alabama Amateur field. South Alabama junior Jacob LeCroy also broke the scoring record posted by Lorenz in 2018 with a 269. Shooting a third round 63, LeCroy had an opportunity to keep Sargent in his crosshairs. Unfortunately for LeCroy, his record-breaking performance was not enough this week as he came up five shots short of Sargent, securing a solo second-place finish despite shooting a 65 on Saturday.\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t trying to sit back and let him take it,” LeCroy told the Alabama Golf Association. “But he did. I broke the total, but he shattered it. He is the best golfer I’ve played with in a long time, and he’s on his way up.”\r\n\r\nMathers also had high praise for Sargent.\r\n\r\n“Today, there was no catching Gordon,” Mathers said. “I would’ve had to shoot 60 to beat him by one overall. Hats off to him.”\r\n\r\nAs for Sargent himself, he’s definitely ready to get things going at Bandon.\r\n\r\n“It’s nice to put it all together and make some birdies,” Sargent said. “This gives me major momentum heading into the U.S. Amateur.”",

Thinking his ball was in the bunker, he and his caddie approached it only to see -- nothing. With the ball nowhere in sight, his heart started beating a a little faster.  <br><br>\r\n\r\n“Seventeen into the wind,” Coody said to the Indy Star. “It’s just brutal.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut after he and his caddie located it hiding in a drain, he took a free drop (outside the bunker) chipped from an awkward lie onto the green and made a 20-foot par save to close out Neergaard-Petersen. <br><br>\r\n\r\n“I kind of had a feeling he was going to make it,” Neergaard-Petersen said of Coody’s last putt. “He had a great chip.”<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"The Western Amateur is one of the biggest events of the year,\" Coody said after the victory. \"To see my name next to that list of names is humbling and amazing.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nCoody is the 7th Texas Longhorn golfer to win the prestigious title, and the list portends well for his golf future. Starting with Rik Massengale in 1968, the list goes on to include Ben Crenshaw (1973); Justin Leonard (1992 & 1993); John Klauk (2002); <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/8470/Beau-Hossler?p=1\">Beau Hossler</a> (2014) and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/15400/Cole-Hammer?p=1\">Cole Hammer</a> (2018).<br><br>\r\n\r\nHe's been around the game his entire life - playing golf with his twin brother Parker (who also plays for Texas) and caddying for grandfather Charles, the 1971 Masters champion, in the par-3 contest at Augusta National. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Parker and Pierceson Coody from their caddie days <a href=\"https://t.co/0PANLcU1nk\">pic.twitter.com/0PANLcU1nk</a></p>— Brentley Romine (@BrentleyGC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrentleyGC/status/1133421865400193025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 28, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><br>\r\n\r\nNeergaard-Peterson, who plays for Oklahoma State, decided to stay in the U.S. after the spring NCAA season was cut short, due to the lack of tournaments in Denmark.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I could have gone home, but there wouldn’t have been any tournaments to play in,” he told Golf Oklahoma after winning the Oklahoma Stroke Play at 14 under. “So I’m going to play here all summer.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt was a wise decision.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062362.jpg\"><br>Rasmus Neergaard-Petersen</div></div>Although he came up short today at Crooked Stick, the 2018 and 2019 German International champ would have earned a guaranteed spot in the U.S. Amateur, but he didn't need it after the USGA included him in the list of exempt players when the field was published on July 27. <br><br>\r\n\r\nCoody, who was exempt using a number of criteria -- including his final 16 U.S. Am finish at Pinehurst in 2019 -- is one to watch at Bandon Dunes.

Thompson, a senior at Georgia and the fourth-ranked player in the world, was the medalist last year.\r\n\r\nTrailing 5 down through six, Duangmanee, the 208th-ranked player, won seven of the last 12 holes to defeat Thompson in 19.\r\n\r\n“Honestly, I was almost ready to go home because he was playing insane golf,” Duangmanee said. “But I stayed patient and waited for my opportunities to come, and I capitalized on them.”\r\n\r\nDuangmanee will play <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22195/Pierceson-Coody?p=1\">Pierceson Coody</a>, of Plano, Texas, in Saturday’s semifinals.

    "teaser": "132 players will tee it up at Woodmont CC; see who they are and how the USGA built the field in the absence of qualifying",
    "articleText": "The month of July is typically a time when the USGA puts its Open championships in the rearview mirror and starts looking ahead to the heart of its amateur schedule.\r\n\r\nBut these are not normal times. COVID-19 has changed everything and the USGA is not immune. Ten of its 14 championships were canceled, while the Association’s two oldest amateur championships – the U.S. Women’s Amateur and U.S. Amateur – are being contested in their originally scheduled slots, albeit with smaller fields and strict protocols.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nBecause of health and safety concerns, the USGA had to make the difficult decision to cancel all qualifying and resort to an all-exempt field.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Women’s Amateur at Woodmont Country Club in Rockville, Md., will feature a field of 132 competitors rather than the typical 156. Here’s a look at three of the 2020 exemptions:\r\n\r\n<b>Play-In Games</b>\r\n\r\nUnder normal circumstances, the few big summer women’s events on the competition calendar provide an opportunity for players to raise their profile in the Women’s World Amateur Golf Ranking® (WAGR). In 2020, some of these events are offering exemptions into the U.S. Women’s Amateur. The winners and runners-up of the Women’s North & South Amateur, the Women’s Western Amateur and Ladies National Amateur (formerly the Trans-National) all get into the field.\r\n\r\nThree players managed to earn spots at Woodmont by virtue of their play in these events. Jackie Lucena, a University of California-Davis rising junior, reached the final of the 120th Women’s Western Amateur, falling to previously exempt player Brigitte Thibault, of Canada.\r\n\r\nTwo players earned Women’s Am spots in the 90th Ladies National Golf Association Amateur, formerly called the Trans-National, on July 29. Exempt player Rachel Kuehn, who also captured the Women’s North & South at Pinehurst three weeks ago, won by six strokes. University of Kentucky rising sophomore Marissa Wenzler and Southern Methodist rising junior Kennedy Pedigo shared second to earn their way to Woodmont.\r\n\r\nThe other finalist in the 118th Women’s North & South – Allisen Corpuz – was also already in the U.S. Women’s Amateur and didn’t need the exemption.\r\n\r\n<b>Ranking Expanded</b>\r\n\r\nSince 2012, the USGA has been utilizing the WAGR to help determine exemptions for its championships. For elite international players, it means not having to fly thousands of miles to play in a qualifier. Since adopting the criteria, the USGA has exempted the top 25 points leaders into the Women’s Amateur. That number was expanded to 75 for the 2020 championship, opening the door for players such as No. 49 Kaleigh Telfer, of South Africa and No. 65 Pilar Echeverria, of Guatemala, to get into the field.\r\n\r\nRecognizing that the U.S. Women’s Amateur usually has a contingent of junior qualifiers, the USGA added a special WAGR category for the top 20 points leaders who don’t turn 19 prior to Aug. 9, the last day of the championship. One player took advantage of this exemption: incoming Stanford freshman Sadie Englemann.\r\n\r\n<b>2019 Performances</b>\r\n\r\nWhen Grace Summerhays left SentryWorld, in Stevens Point, Wis., after being eliminated in the Round of 16 of the 2019 U.S. Girls’ Junior, she was thrilled about the great run in her first USGA event. A week earlier, older brother Preston had won the U.S. Junior Amateur at Inverness Club, in Toledo, Ohio, so the family was already in a celebratory mood. Little did Grace know just how valuable that performance was last July. Under the revised exemption categories, any player reaching the Round of 16 in the 2019 U.S. Girls’ Junior got a spot in the field, making Summerhays one of nine players to get in strictly through that category.\r\n\r\nA couple of U.S. Women’s Mid-Amateur champions, Meghan Stasi (4) and Lauren Greenlief (1)  also made the field at Woodmont in a 2020-only category, thanks to being  semifinalists in last year’s championship at Forest Highlands Golf Club, in Flagstaff, Ariz..\r\n\r\nAnother beneficiary was seven-time USGA champion Ellen Port, who got into the field via her 2016 U.S. Senior Women’s Amateur triumph. She is the only senior player (50 and older) in the field. Two years ago at The Golf Club of Tennessee, she advanced to match play, one month shy of her 57th birthday.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/championships/2020/u-s--women-s-amateur/articles/2020-u-s--women-s-amateur-field.html\" target=\"_blank\">The list of 132 golfers currently in the 2020 U.S. Women's Amateur field can be found here</a>.",

Falling back to 1-under on the day following bogeys on holes 7 and 8, Jennings capped off the front side with a birdie on No. 9.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nDespite the small stumble, Jennings felt confident.\r\n\r\n“After making that putt on No. 6, I felt confident and knew that I had a good chance to be in contention,” Jennings told the Carolinas Golf Association.\r\n\r\n6-under for the tournament through nine, Jennings knew he had to make something happen as the leaders were a group behind him. In that last group was then-leader Gene Zeigler (Florence, South Carolina). At 10-under as Jennings made the turn, Zeigler was the rabbit that needed to be chased down.\r\n\r\n“I went 4-under on the back nine [Wednesday], so I knew I could go low,” Jennings said. “I had to do that, and it happened.”\r\n\r\nPosting a 2-under back nine, Jennings headed into the clubhouse at 8-under, needing a bit of help from Zeigler in the form of at least a couple of bogeys. Zeigler obliged with bogeys on 16 and 18 to set up a playoff with Jennings.\r\n\r\n“It was nerve-wracking standing and watching Gene finish,” Jennings said. “I honestly thought I had lost, but he gave me an opening so I took it.”\r\n\r\nThe duo both birdied the par-5 18th on the first playoff hole. Playing the closing hole for a third time that day, Jennings found that the third time is the charm. Sliding an eagle putt by, his birdie bested Zeigler’s par for the win.\r\n\r\n“I was worried that Gene was going to chip it in for birdie, but after the chip, I knew that I could two-putt for birdie and win,” said Jennings. “When my putt finally went in, I just felt relieved. Last week I lost by one stroke, so this win feels even better.”\r\n\r\nRounding out the top-5 were Max Green (Hilton Head Island, South Carolina) at 6-under (204), Griffin Tarver (205), and Tyler DeChellis (Clayton, North Carolina) who finished at 4-under (206).",

    "articleText": "Happy Hollow Country Club has lived up to its name for Andy Sajevic. \r\n\r\nWinning his first Nebraska State Amateur title at the club in 2010, the former North Carolina Tarheel added his name to the trophy for the fourth time on Thursday.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHolding the 36-hole lead, the Fremont, Nebraska native stumbled down the stretch in the third round with a pair of bogeys, giving the 54-hole lead to Southeastern Community College head coach Calvin Freeman.\r\n\r\nIn Thursday’s final round, scoring was hard to come by as windy conditions and final round pin locations made Happy Hollow tougher than the first three days. Posting a 1-over-par 72, Sajevic was able to tread water as Freeman and others faltered in the breeze.\r\n\r\n“With 72-holes, you know it’s going to be a marathon,” the 29-year-old told the Nebraska Golf Association. “I hit it well and made some putts when I needed to.”\r\n\r\nStaying bogey-free through 16 holes, Sajevic was 1-under before closing the tournament with back-to-back bogeys. Although not finishing in the best fashion, he picked up the win with a 3-under 281 total and joins Alex Schaake, Rod Bliss Jr., Sam Reynolds, and Bob Astleford on the shortlist of four-time Nebraska Amateur winners.\r\n\r\nFreeman carded a final-round 76 (284), finishing runner-up to Sajevic just as he did in 2013. University of Nebraska's Tom Westenberger took home a third-place finish at 2-over-par (286). Iowa Western sophomore Grant Jabenis snagged fourth place at 3-over (287).",

As the only competitor in the field to finish the event under par, Longbella took advantage of tough course conditions to further lengthen his lead.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n\"Milwaukee is pretty easy off the tee,\" Longbella told AmateurGolf.com. \"The greens were where everyone was making their big numbers.

Unceremoniously consistent, Longbella saw his lead grow larger and larger as the field simply could not muster any red numbers to give him a run for his money.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing changes,\" said Longbella. \"Yeah I do have a six-shot lead, but I'm still going out there playing the same golf course I played the first three days.

That's something you don't see every day.\"\r\n\r\nThe dramatic ending by Manuel allowed him to finish the tourney with a 9-under 67-66=133, setting a junior amateur record for low score and tying the record for relation to par.\r\n\r\nOuellette, who made the eagle putt on 18, finished with an 8-under 66-68=134.\r\n\r\nThe two players battled throughout the final round. Ouellete had a one-shot lead at the start of the round and went up two shots with a birdie on the sixth hole. But Manuel battled back and tied the match with a birdie on the 15th hole. The pair was tied again after the 17th hole, setting up the amazing finish.\r\n\r\nManuel is scheduled to play in The Maine Event, a tourney limited to only Maine professionals and amateurs, on Aug. 12-13 at Augusta Country Club, before he heads to Storrs for his freshman year.",

I tried not to make mistakes coming in. There are some pins out here you just can’t go at.”\r\n\r\nThe Norwalk, Iowa native not only carried his overnight lead to a championship win, but he built off of it, winning by six shots.\r\n\r\nFinishing runner-up as the only other competitor under-par was 2020 Iowa Golf Association Match Play winner Connor Peck. Peck, a University of Kansas senior, closed out the tournament with an even-par 70 for a 209 (-1) total.\r\n\r\nBull used past experiences to take home the IGA Amateur as he worked at Davenport Country Club as a cart attendant in exchange for playing privileges.\r\n\r\n“I have played here (at DCC) 15-20 times here prior to this event,” Bull said. “I worked the cart barn out here one or two nights a week (several years ago), so I could play out here.”\r\n\r\nGriffin Parker (Northern Iowa) and Trent Lindenman tied for third at 1-over-par.",

Today, the championship culminated with a 36-hole match play final won by Joey Vrzich of nearby El Cajon.<br><br>\r\n\r\nVrzich was one of four Pepperdine Waves to advance to the round-pf-16 in match play -- not surprising given the Div. 1 golf team's No. 1 national ranking at the end of the shortened NCAA season.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen three of his teammates (Dylan Menante, Braden Fioroni, and Josh McCarthy) were eliminated on Thursday, Vrzich was left to represent the Waves (and keep the title won by a teammate last year), and boy did he ever.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith defending champ and fellow Wave William Mouw competing at the Western Amateur at Crooked Stick, Vrzich got down to business in today's final against Charlie Reiter of Palm Desert, and University of San Diego.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe pair traded off pars and birdies in the morning, with both posting sub-70 medal play equivalent scores at the tough Torrey Pines South Course, and Vrzich taking a narrow 1-up advantage to the lunch break after 18 holes.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, it looked like Vrzich would run away with it, taking the first hole with a par, the third with a birdie, and the cliffside fourth with a par. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBut Reiter fought back, bringing things back within two holes after a birdie at No. 7, the hole where Tiger Woods famously defeated Rocco Mediate after their 18-hole sudden death round ended deadlocked at the 2008 U.S. Open.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNever giving up the 2-up advantage, Vrzich finally put the match dormie with a birdie on No. 15, the match's 33rd hole. He won it at the par-3 16th when both players made par. <br><br>\r\n\r\nVrzich is exempt to play. in the U.S. Amateur at the end of the month at Bandon Dunes.

Triplett liked what he saw.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“What didn’t impress me about Sam?,” replied Triplett when asked by about his partner at the time. “He’s a fabulous player with a fabulous swing. He’s also got tremendous poise and has the ability to bounce back.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nThose are the qualities that allowed Sommerhauser to come back from 2-down after 10 holes, winning the tough par-3 11th with a par, and the par-5 13th with a birdie, before making eagle on the par-4 14th -- where the front tee location allowed players to have a go at the green. <br><br>\r\n\r\nA birdie at No. 17 was the difference for Sommerhauser, in what would be one of the tightest matches of the day he won 1-up. That's the same margin that <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/25521/Harrison-Kingsley?p=1\">Harrison Kingsley</a> needed to defeat Pepperdine Wave <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/26447/Caden-Fioroni?p=1\">Caden Fioroni</a> of San Diego. <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24558/Dylan-Menante?p=1\">Dylan Menante</a> of Carlsbad, the third Wave to go out in the first round, lost to <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/64206/Alex-Chin\">Alexander Chin</a> of Pleasanton. Chin, a senior at University of San Francisco, took control with a run of three-straight birdies on Holes 8-10, winning all three.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhile three of the four Pepperdine Waves lost their matches today, University of Arizona went two-for-three. Sommerhauser is an incoming freshman with the Wildcats, will face his future teammate, UA sophomore <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/97839/Chase-Sienkiewicz\">Chase Sienkiewicz</a>, tomorrow in the quarterfinals at 6:54 am.

But two-for-three isn't bad. As they say in Tucson, Bear Down!<br><br>\r\n\r\nTwo golfers who won nail-biters against favorites in the first round had much less trouble advancing today.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21472/Charlie-Reiter?p=1\">Charlie Reiter</a> of Palm Desert, who transferred this year from USC to University of San Diego, defeated 2018 U.S. Amateur runner-up <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21955/Devon-Bling?p=1\">Devon Bling</a> in the first round, 2-and-1.

    "articleText": "<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/19694/Kyle-Hogan?p=1\">Kyle Hogan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18732/Turk-Pettit?p=1\">Turk Pettit</a> are tied for the 36-hole lead at the Western Amateur, as the field will be cut to 44 players and ties at the end of the round.\r\n\r\nTearing his way through the front nine at Crooked Stick, Hogan (Texas Tech) made four birdies and five pars on his way to a 32, after opening with a 2-under 70 on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nWe don't think Hogan is related to Ben, but he certainly played to his name today (and he is also from Texas). Carrying momentum into the back nine, Hogan eagled the par-4 11th before giving one back at the next hole for his lone bogey of the day. He played the rest of the way. in at 1-under for a 66 and 36-hole total of 8-under 136.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nPettit, a Clemson senior from Sugar Grove, North Carolina -- who went out earlier Wednesday morning -- is tied with Hogan after posting his second-straight 4-under 68.\r\n\r\nPettit carded six birdies, but gave two shots back with a double bogey for his second consecutive 68. He is trying to make the match play portion of the Western Amateur for the second time in two appearances.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18671/Matthias-Schmid?p=1\">Matthias Schmid</a>, of Moxhuette, Germany and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/19701/Joseph-Pagdin?p=1\">Joseph Pagdin</a>, of Sheffield, England, are both a shot back at 7-under after each posted 69 on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nPagdin, a freshman at Florida, birdied five of his last 10 holes today.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t get off to the best start, hitting some loose shots and making mistakes,” he told the Western Golf Association. “But I drained some good putts and got on a roll. I’m happy with my round, but I could have gotten more out of it. I love the course. It can bite you when it wants, but it also rewards good shots.”\r\n\r\nMaybe the most expected but unexpected performance is just wrapping up at press time. We predicted that <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/17104/Quade-Cummins?p=1\">Quade Cummins</a> was going to be in the Western Amateur mix, but he was in severe danger of missing the cut after a 2-over 74 on Tuesday. \r\n\r\nBut Cummins is ranked No. 1 in the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-rankings/golfweek-agc-men\">Golfweek/AmateurGolf.com World Amateur Ranking</a> for a reason. He's coming off 3rd and 4th place finishes at the Southern and Sunnehanna Amateurs -- two \"<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/TheMajorsOfAmateurGolf\">Majors of Amateur Golf</a>\" -- and today he roared back with a birdie-eagle run at Nos. 8 and 9 to shoot 32 on the front, and has recorded another birdie on the back to get to 3-under on the tournament. Cleanly under the 36-hole cut, Cummins can focus on making it to the \"Sweet-16\" tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAnother guy to watch heading into match play is <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/76098/Andy-Ogletree\">Andy Ogletree</a>. The winner of the 2019 U.S. Amateur is ready to defend at Bandon Dunes in late August. At 6-under after 36-holes, he seems poised to make a run here and perhaps bring a little more hardware with him to Oregon. We certainly wouldn't bet against him if he makes the Sweet-16.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/63762/Ricky-Castillo\">Ricky Castillo</a>, of Yorba Linda, California, and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/23234/Alexander-Yang?p=1\">Alexander Yang</a>, of Carlsbad, California, are both at 5-under. Castillo, who made match play last year, was also on everyone's early Western Amateur watch list.\r\n\r\nAnother Californian, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24757/William-Mouw?p=1\">William Mouw</a> of Chino, appears to be validating his decision to forego a California Amateur title defense to play in the Western. After two rounds of 69, Mouw sits at 6-under and well-positioned for a Sweet-16 run.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24499/Preston-Summerhays?p=1\">Preston Summerhays</a>, the reigning U.S. Junior champion who won last week's Sunnehanna Amateur, shot a 70 to make the cut at 1 under par, two shots out of the 16th spot.\r\n\r\nThe cut fell at even par, with 46 players at or below that number. Among those missing out is the defending champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/52007/Garrett-Rank\">Garrett Rank</a> of Canada, who shot rounds of 74-73 to fall three shots short. <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/19645/John-Pak?p=1\">John Pak</a>, who recently debuted at No. 1 in the first-ever <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/27220/John-Pak-tops-first-ever-PGA-Tour-University-ranking\">PGA Tour University Ranking</a>, missed the cut by two shots.\r\n\r\nOthers whose tournament ended after two rounds include the recent Southern Amateur winner <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22047/McClure-Meissner?p=1\">McClure Meissner</a>, the U.S. Amateur runner-up <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18421/John-Augenstein?p=1\">John Augenstein</a>, and 2018 British Amateur champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/13009/Jovan-Rebula?p=1\">Jovan Rebula</a>.\r\n\r\nTwo rounds will be played on Thursday, with a playoff if need to pare the field down to the Sweet 16 who will advance to match play.",

    "articleText": "Michael Brown had a wild front nine in the final round of the 107th Pennsylvania Amateur championship.\r\n\r\nPar-less until the ninth hole, the 45-year-old former pro began his day with four-straight birdies making it look as though he would run away with the title. Holding a one-stroke lead over the field heading into Wednesday’s final round, the 2019 Pennsylvania Golf Association Amateur Player of the Year went from 7 under to 11 under in the blink of an eye.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nBut just as quickly, he fell back to earth, dropping bogeys on Nos. 5, 6, and 7. Gaining a shot back with a birdie on No. 8, Brown capped off his electric front side with a par on No. 9 for an eventful 2-under 34.\r\n\r\nBrown leveled out on the back nine with a single birdie on No. 10 and eight consecutive pars to hold off a pair of surging competitors for a 206 total and a one-shot victory.\r\n\r\nRick Stimmel and William Davenport came up just short in their efforts to chase down Brown. Stimmel, who began the day three back of Brown, posted a 5-under 67 which included two eagles (Nos. 8 and 13). Although carding two eagles, Stimmel had one too many bogeys as he finished one shot shy of Brown.\r\n\r\nDavenport began the day two shots off the lead at 5-under. Out in 34, Davenport holed out on his approach shot into the par-4 10th to kick off the back nine. Making five straight pars, he slipped with his first bogey of the day on 16. Making it up on 17, the error proved to be the difference between a T-2 and a possible playoff.\r\n\r\nBrown credited an attitude adjustment for securing the title.\r\n\r\n“The reason I didn’t succeed as a professional was my self-image wasn’t as strong as it needed to be,” said Brown to the Pennsylvania Golf Association. “I told myself this morning, ‘Who here is more prepared for today and Lookaway?’ I said ‘Nobody.’ I spent last night and this morning pumping myself up because I believed I could win. And it was genuine. I love coming here and I know the golf course so well.”",

    "teaser": "Following the PGA of America's lead, Detroit Golf Club renames the tournament that was a tribute to its long-time pro",
    "articleText": "By <a href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/golf/2020/07/27/horton-smiths-name-removed-detroit-golf-club-tournament/5522855002/\" target=\"_blank\">Tony Paul of the The Detroit News</a>\r\n\r\nArguably the state's most prestigious and exclusive amateur golf tournament, the Horton Smith Invitational is getting a new name.\r\n\r\nHeld annually at Detroit Golf Club as a tribute to the club's former head professional and inaugural Masters champion, the tournament, effectively immediately, will be called the Michigan Medal Play, the tournament committee told the club this week.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe committee's decision follows the PGA of America's early July announcement that it was removing Smith's name from one of its top annual awards because of Smith's staunch support of whites-only membership while PGA president in the 1950s.\r\n\r\nThe PGA of America had a whites-only clause from 1934 through 1961.\r\n\r\n\"In renaming the Horton Smith Award, the PGA of America is taking ownership of a failed chapter in our history that resulted in excluding many from achieving their dreams of earning the coveted PGA member badge and advancing the game of golf,\" PGA president Suzy Whaley said in a statement earlier this month — in fact, the statement was made July 2, which happened to be the first day of the PGA Tour's Rocket Mortgage Classic at Detroit Golf Club, Smith's home course. \"We need to do all we can to ensure the PGA of America is defined by inclusion. Part of our mission to grow the game is about welcoming all and bringing diversity to the sport.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Detroit Golf Club's board of directors obtained by The News on Monday, the tournament committee said: \"In support of the recent decision by the PGA to change the name of the Horton Smith Award to the PGA Development Award, the Horton Smith Committee will remove Horton Smith’s name from our championship. Effective immediately, the tournament will be the Michigan Medal Play at Detroit Golf Club.\"\r\n\r\nThe invitational is held in the spring, and has taken place at Detroit Golf Club every year since 1964, the year after Smith died.\r\n\r\nIn 1971, the tournament merged with the Michigan Medal Play — which was played at a rotating series of Metro Detroit clubs — and is a 72-hole stroke-play championship with a 36-hole cut.\r\n\r\nSmith won the first Masters in 1934, won it again in 1936 and had 32 PGA Tour wins. He's a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame and Michigan Golf Hall of Fame.\r\n\r\nSmith was head pro at Detroit Golf Club from 1946 until his death. He was president of the PGA of American from 1952-54. \r\n\r\nOne notable exception to the whites-only rule Smith trumpeted during his tenure as PGA president came in January 1952, when Detroit legend and boxing great Joe Louis — who picked up golf in retirement, notably at Rackham in Huntington Woods — was allowed to play in a tournament in San Diego in 1952.\r\n\r\nMultiple times in the last several weeks, The News has reached out to Detroit Golf Club officials to inquire about the future of the tournament's name. General manager Derek Jacques and head professional Josh Upson didn't return messages, and club president Mark Douglas declined to comment on the matter, saying the tournament isn't officially run by the club but rather a committee.\r\n\r\n\"We are just the host course,\" Douglas said.\r\n\r\nThe tournament, which was canceled this year because of COVID-19, was the biggest annual event at Detroit Golf Club until two years ago, when the club landed the PGA Tour's Rocket Mortgage Classic.",

The second round was cut short due to darkness after weather delayed play.\r\n\r\nUnable to replicate her near-perfect 6-under 30 on the front nine from the first round, Kuehn birdied the par-4 first and then added nine pars before play was suspended.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nWaiting in the wings just one shot behind Kuehn is Louisville’s Lauren Thibodeau. After an opening 68, Thibodeau was even par through the front side Tuesday with a birdie on No. 7 canceling out a bogey on No. 9.\r\n\r\nAmong the handful to finish their rounds were Carly Burkhardt (Furman) and Brooke Riley (Northwestern). The pair sit just three shots behind Kuehn at 3 under. With Riley putting together a one-under 71 and Burkhardt carding a 3-under 69, they are in a decent position to attack when the third round commences following the conclusion of the remainder of the second round Wednesday morning.\r\n\r\nBurkhardt and Riley are joined by SMU’s Kennedy Pedigo at 3-under. Pedigo, through 16 holes, looks to make up some more ground before the third round begins.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of second-round play, the field will be cut to top-60 and ties as the event heads to the final round on Wednesday.",

    "articleText": "We've been watching <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/89465/Maxwell-Moldovan\">Maxwell Moldovan</a> (Uniontown, Ohio) since his junior golf days. \r\n\r\nThe rising star aged out of his junior career in style last month in North Carolina, birdieing his final five holes to take the clubhouse lead at the AJGA Invitational, the last junior event of his career. He ended up finishing 2 shots behind eventual winner David Ford, but what a way to \"graduate\" to amateur and collegiate golf.\r\n\r\nThat was on June 12, when he told us \"I'm excited about the summer of amateur events\" - and with since he is exempt by way of making the round-of-64 at last year's U.S. Amateur, that journey will continue to Bandon Dunes in late August.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nBut for now, the big prize is the endurance test known as the Western Amateur, just four years \"younger\" (1899) than the U.S. and British Amateurs which were founded in 1895.\r\n\r\nToday at Crooked Stick Golf Club in Indianapolis, Moldovan avoided a bogey; not an easy task on such a \"big\" course that has hosted two World Golf Championships in the last 10 years.\r\n\r\nGoing out with nine straight pars, Moldovan was loving the odd numbers on the back nine, recording birdies on Nos. 11, 13, and 15. A par on No. 17 stopped the symmetry, but not the momentum -- the Ohio State freshman-to-be birdied the last to post 32 on the back nine and a 4-under 68 on the round.\r\n\r\n\"I was really happy with how I played today,\" Moldovan told AmateurGolf.com. \"The course is a great test. It’s long, it’s tight off the tee, and the greens are tough.\"\r\n\r\nThe key stretch for Moldovan was a clutch seven-footer for par on the 12th, followed by a chip-in birdie on 13. \"That kept the momentum for the closing stretch, which is really good at Crooked Stick,\" said Moldovan. \"I was able to make some good birdie putts today and lots of good chips to give myself tap-in pars.\"\r\n\r\nAlso posting 68 -- <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/167345/Connor-Creasy\">Connor Creasy</a> of Abington, Virginia. The Georgia Bulldog had five birdies and just a single bogey on No. 10. \r\n\r\nThe pair are joined at the top of the leaderboard by University of Florida commit <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/19701/Joseph-Pagdin?p=1\">Joseph Pagdin</a> of England, University of Louisville senior <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18671/Matthias-Schmid?p=1\">Mattias Schmid</a> of Germany, and Clemson senior <A href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18732/Turk-Pettit?p=1\">Turk Pettit</a>.\r\n\r\nAmong the large group of ten players one shot back at 3 under are World No. 4 <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18654/Davis-Thompson?p=1\">Davis Thompson</a> of the University of Georgia and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24757/William-Mouw?p=1\">William Mouw</a>, who chose not to defend his California Amateur title in favor of playing in the Western Amateur.\r\n\r\nAnother nine players are at 2 under, including the reigning U.S. Amateur champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/76098/Andy-Ogletree\">Andy Ogletree</a>. In all, an eye-popping 40 players are within three shots of the lead.\r\n\r\nDefending champ <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/52007/Garrett-Rank\">Garrett Rank</a> posted a disappointing 74 and will have to get some momentum going on Wednesday if he is to contend for the title as the field gets whittled down to 44 after 36-holes and those players then play an additional 36 to determine the \"sweet-16.\"\r\n\r\nAlso in the group at 74 who we predicted would do well here are <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/17104/Quade-Cummins?p=1\">Quade Cummins</a> of Oklahoma and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22047/McClure-Meissner?p=1\">McClure Meissner</a> of SMU, recent winner of the Southern Amateur at Maridoe.\r\n\r\nPlaying all of that recent golf -- Cummins just finished 3rd and 4th at the Southern Amateur and Sunnehanna in back to back weeks -- can wear on a person, but don't be surprised to see any of those three players post a low number on Wednesday in an attempt to move on.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, Moldovan also played the last two \"majors\" but finished outside of the top-30 in both events.",

Cole Cotton States Invitational. It wasn’t that the Ole Miss golfer was playing bad overall, but inopportune gaffes had him trailing upstart Mitchell Ford by two strokes through 13 holes.\r\n\r\n“I made a bad mistake there out of a bunker and gifted him a hole,” Gnam said. “From there on, I just decided I wasn’t going to lose this match.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nWhile keeping his cool mentally, Gnam’s game caught fire on holes 15 and 16. After sinking a putt on the 18th hole to force a sudden death playoff, Gnam outlasted Ford on the 20th hole to win the 2020 Cotton States championship at Bayou DeSiard Country Club.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been involved in this tournament for 11 years and I’ve never seen a final match go extra holes,” Cotton States tournament director Stewart Causey said. “It was a great final match with lots of ups and downs and we had quite a crowd out here to watch it.”\r\n\r\nNeeding the putt on 18 to force a playoff, Gnam never considered an outcome other than winning the hole.\r\n\r\n“I kind of had a good idea of the line and the only thing I was thinking of over the put was what I was going to do after it went it,” Gnam said. “You always say you expect it to go in, but it was a rush to have it go in.”\r\n\r\nFord, a Little Rock, Arkansas-native, started the tournament 23rd on the bracket and played his way into the championship match. He held a two-stroke lead coming off 10 and 13 and clung to a one-stroke advantage on 18.\r\n\r\n“I was so grateful to Mr. Causey for letting me in the tournament,” Ford said. “I shouldn’t have been here or in the finals. I beat a lot of people that were better than me and I’m just extremely grateful to be here.”\r\n\r\nGnam credited his comeback to a pitching adjustment following a slow start.\r\n\r\n“I just added about half a cup to my read and I did that the rest of the day,” Gnam said. “I hit maybe two bad shots, but I just wasn’t making putts and I knew I had to be patient and not let myself get mad.”",

    "teaser": "Former Cal-Berkeley standout Stephen Hale finishes 36 holes at 7 under and will be the No. 1 match play seed at Torrey Pines",
    "articleText": "Former Cal-Berkeley standout Stephen Hale took home medalist honors as the medal play portion of the California Amateur concluded on Tuesday. \r\n\r\nHale, who opened with the 6-under 66 on the North Course yesterday and shot 71 on the more difficult South  today, will be the No.1 seed when match play begins Wednesday at Torrey Pines GC.\r\n\r\nHale, who attempted a professional career but then regained his amateur status, finished stroke play qualifying with a 36-hole total of 7-under par 137.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHale told AmateurGolf.com that the round on the South Course \"was a bit of a struggle early\" but that he grinded out the round without thinking about whether he could come out on top of qualifying.\r\n\r\n\"I had no thoughts about [being] medalist all day,\" said Hale. \"I just wanted to get into the match play round and give myself a chance. It's a huge bonus to be the medalist.\"\r\n\r\nFive players, including NorCal’s Mikey Slesinski, defending NCGA Amateur champion Josh McCarthy and Matt Cohn, along with Southern Cal golfers Anthony Truong (Irvine) and Torrey Edwards (Long Beach), finished tied for second at 138. \r\n\r\nAnd the odds of a Southern California player winning got a little better going into match play; 22 of the qualifiers are from Southern California, while only 10 NorCal players made the cut, which came at 2-under 142.\r\n\r\n<b>ROUND ONE SUMMARY</b>\r\n\r\nOn a perfect day for scoring, the medal play portion of the 109th California Amateur teed off today at both the North and South Courses of Torrey Pines. \r\n\r\nAnd one of them, if he wins, might add a second R to his first name.\r\n\r\nThat would be Torey Edwards, of Long Beach, a former mini-tour journeyman who blistered his way around the host course of the U.S. Open with a 6-under 66.\r\n\r\nEdwards, who won the 2019 Long Beach City Championship and owns the course record of 58 at Long Beach's Recreation Park, is in great shape heading over to the North tomorrow, as the South is considered 2-3 shots harder than the North.\r\n\r\nAfter three straight pars to start and a birdie on a hole we featured in our preview (the cliffside fourth) Edwards found some magic as he turned to the back nine. He went 4-under on Nos. 8-10 thanks to a birdie on No. 8 (a par-3), an eagle on the par-5 9th, and another birdie at the 10th to start his back nine.\r\n\r\nAlthough he took a bogey on No. 12, anyone that has played the South can tell you that it plays almost like a par-5 and he didn't give anything back to the field there. Bouncing back with a birdie on the par-5 13th and adding another to finish on the 18th led to the low score of the day by two shots on the South for Edwards.\r\n\r\nHe played the par-5 holes in 4-under, only failing to make birdie on No. 6 but making that up with his eagle on No. 9. They are the secret to scoring on the South, especially for long hitters on warm days like today. \r\n\r\nEdwards was humble in describing his length when describing his eagle on No. 9.\r\n\r\n\"I used to be very long,\" said Edwards over email. \"Now all these youngsters kill it. I still consider myself one of the longer hitters. I hit Driver, 3 wood from 280 on 9. It stopped 7 feet away and I was able to make that.\"\r\n\r\nEdwards went on to say that he was very pleased to shoot 66 on a course as hard as the South, and beyond the length credited the position he was in off the tee with his ability to attack flags.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n\"It’s a long ball hitters golf course but very tough to score on from the rough,\" he explained. \"i  was able to put the ball in positions that allowed me to be aggressive into the greens.\"\r\n\r\nJust as Tiger Woods dominated the South for years with his length and iron prowess (and he could putt a little), a player like Edwards will be tough to beat in match play.\r\n\r\nEdwards is not alone at 6-under, however.\r\n\r\nStephen Hale of Bakersfield, a former Cal Berkeley golfer, went to work early on the North Course. Teeing off at 7:05, Hale attacked the vulnerable North Course with a quick birdie on the first hole. But the dogleg left fourth grabbed a shot back from him, but that was all it could do to fight back as Hale birdied back-to-back on Nos. 6 and 7 (both par-4s). \r\n\r\nHale, another reinstated amateur who toiled for a while on the mini tours -- playing as far away as Ecuador -- birdied consecutive holes again at the par-5 9th and 10th holes, and did it one more time on Nos. 16 and 17. \r\n\r\n\"I took advantage of the par 5s and wedge [approach shots],\" Hale told AmateurGolf.com via text. \r\n\r\n\"I didn’t do anything crazy just struck it nice and kept it in the right spots,\" he continued. \"The course was in great shape and the SCGA did a great job setting it up. You can get to a lot of the pins but if you are a little off it leaves you in tricky spots.\"\r\n\r\nIn assessing the round shot by his co-leader Edwards on the South, Hale was pretty straightforward.\r\n\r\n\"I have to think Torey’s round on the South was awesome.\"\r\n\r\nAs for the depth of the field, consider this-- a full 40-plus players (almost a third of those who teed off) posted a red number today.\r\n\r\nThe second round goes off tomorrow, with players flipping courses. No spectators will be allowed again, but starting with Wednesday's round-of-32 in match play the public can enjoy the gorgeous views of Torrey Pines. \r\n\r\nOr is it Torey Pines?",

    "articleText": "One of California's most historic amateur championships went missing from the calendar in 2019. It wasn't Coronavirus, but a number of other factors that caused the tournament to miss a year.\r\n\r\nBut the tournament committee, and a group that includes the Brookside Men's Golf Club, Rose Bowl Operations, Brookside GC staff, and AmateurGolf.com convened to make sure that everyone knows, like our former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Pasadena City was going to \" be back.\"\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe traditional dates in April sold out -- right in the middle of golf's shutdown.\r\n\r\nDetermined not to miss a second year, the committee contacted players and a very large percentage of them decided to play on the new July dates. Any that couldn't were replaced by eager golfers form the waiting list.\r\n\r\nThe two names you might expect to do battle for the title, Dan Sullivan and Tim Hogarth, were not only there, they rose to the top.\r\n\r\nFor this year's battle, it was Hogarth (a former USGA Publinx champ who earned a spot into the Masters some years back) who defeated Sullivan (a two-time USGA Mid-Am semifinalist) by two shots.  It was Hogarth's 7th Pasadena City Championship, extending his all-time record.\r\n\r\nHogarth started slow - his first round 75 left him well back of Daniel Ragsdale (the only player to break 70 in the first round with 69). But there was no doubt that Hogarth would find a way to get into the mix, and he did just that with a nearly flawless round on Saturday - a 66 that put him into a tie for third with steady Dan Sullivan who posted rounds of 71 and 70.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, playing the same C.W. Koiner course that was used in round one -- but this time from the Gold tees -- Hogarth caught fire. Seven birdies against just a single bogey put him over the top at 7-under for the tournament, as Sullivan posted his best round of the weekend (a 68) to finish solo second. \r\n\r\nRounding out the top three, Tongun Lako shot a final round 70 to finish solo third at 4-under. The tournament should move to its traditional date in 2021, during the month of April. We're betting it will fill quickly. \r\n\r\nSouthern Californians missed the Pasadena City.",

    "articleText": "You know that old saying in golf, “Sometimes a hole just fits your eye”? What if a whole nine holes that fit your eye?\r\n\r\nThe back nine at Elkhorn Golf Club might have been designed with Hugo Townsend in mind, or at least it seems like it. Townsend played the back nine at Elkhorn in a cumulative 11 strokes under par, shooting 33-31-33 throughout the week.\r\n\r\nStarting the day a stroke behind the leaders, Townsend seemed to have stalled on the front nine, making one birdie and eight pars. Things started moving very quickly though on the back nine. \r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nA bogey on 11 set him back for a moment, but a birdie on 13 put him just 2 shots back of Colt Sherrell. \r\n\r\nThen it happened.\r\n\r\nTownsend stuffed his approach on 15 and drained the putt, while Sherrell lipped out his par putt. A two shot swing.\r\n\r\nTownsend had the honor on the 16th hole, a hole that had been shortened and was certainly reachable. Instead of giving it a go he elected to lay up just short. Then he played maybe the shot of the tournament.  A crafty little bump and run into the hill in front of the green, letting it cozy to about three feet which he promptly buried for another birdie. \r\n\r\nA routine par on 17, and a bogey for Sherrell gave Townsend a two shot lead headed to the 18th, and he never looked back. A very casual birdie on 18 brought him to -10 (206) for the tournament, and a comfortable win.\r\n\r\nAfter losing his spring college season to the pandemic, Townsend sounded more relieved than excited after the round. “It just feels really good to play in a tournament. I’ve been working really hard in the gym and playing a lot with my teammates since I can’t go home (to Sweden) this summer. It just feels really good to have all the hard work pay off.”\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, there’s certainly no better pay off than having a trophy waiting.",

Supported by 60 “interested, avid, and maybe crazy golfers” from the Indianapolis area, Dye formed a corporation to acquire a flat cornfield to be transformed into a golf course. Crooked stick has been described by the Western Golf Association as a blend of Alister Mackenzie, Donald Ross and C.B. Macdonald.<br><br>\r\n\r\nCrooked Stick came into national prominence by hosting the PGA Championship in 1991. That was the same year that the designer of the TPC Sawgrass saw another of his iconic designs gain international attention by hosting the Ryder Cup matches. That course? The Ocean Course at Kiawah Island -- Google \"War by the Shore\" if you haven't heard of it. You won't be disappointed.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>EVANS SCHOLARSHIP</B><br><br>\r\nThe Western Golf Association is not only famous for hosting professional tournaments that raise millions of dollars for worth charities. The WGA also manages the Evans Scholarship Foundation. Established in 1930 by famed golfer Charles “Chick” Evans Jr. and the WGA, the Foundation has awarded full tuition and housing scholarships to more than 11,000 caddies, including 1,010 caddies currently in school. <br><br>\r\n\r\nCrooked Stick has been a steadfast partner of the Evans Scholars Foundation for over 30 years. Twenty-four of those recipients caddied at Crooked Stick, including current Evans Scholar Joe Conway, a freshman at Purdue University. The two BMW Championships hosted by Crooked Stick raised over $6 Million for the foundation; all proceeds from the Western Amateur will go to the program as well.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>SPECTATORS</B><BR><BR>\r\n\r\nAs of virtual press time, no outside spectators will be allowed, however friends and family and members of Crooked Stick will ensure that golf claps are heard around the course. The official website announcement from the WGA follows:<br><br>\r\n<i>\r\nThe Western Golf Association has been carefully monitoring all information regarding the COVID-19 outbreak and remains focused on the health and safety of players and their families, volunteers, supporters and staff. As a result, public spectators will not be permitted to attend the championship this year. Approved player guests, Crooked Stick Members and WGA guests may attend but are required to have a mask and to practice social distancing while on-site. All approved guests will be required to: sign a COVID release waiver when they first arrive; answer a series of screening questions; and have their temperature taken daily upon arrival. Approved guests will not have access to the clubhouse and practice areas.</i>",

Colby Harwell, the defending champion and also a winner in 2017, commanded a spot in the main event with 2&1, 6&5, 1 up, and a 5&4 semifinal win to face off against Hickman on the Tripp Davis redesigned Willow Brook Country Club.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nQuickly pouncing out in front, Hickman took a 5 up advantage as the pair made the turn. Getting out to a fast start helped Hickman all week.\r\n\r\n“Getting that first birdie in each match helped settle the nerves,” Hickman told the Texas Golf Association. “I had four bogeys all week and played the rest of the golf at 31-under par.”\r\n\r\nHickman did not lose a hole until he lost back-to-back holes as Harwell tried to chip away. Three holes up with seven to play, Hickman needed just three more holes to settle the match.\r\n\r\nBirdies on Nos. 12 and 13 gave Hickman a 5 up lead once again. Halving the par-4 14th with Harwell, Hickman ended the match 5&4.\r\n\r\nThe Willow Brook member definitely felt the pressure on his home course but was glad he could get in done in convincing fashion.\r\n\r\n“To play in front of the home crowd brings added pressure with all of the moving parts, but the membership here was so supportive of everything this week,” Hickman said. “They are really excited to host the 2022 Texas Amateur, which is also our 100th anniversary as a club.”\r\n\r\nEven better than winning at home is the self-validation a championship like this can give you.\r\n\r\n“This is validation for all of the hard work I have put in,” said Hickman. “I have won team events, but this is special to do this on my own”.",

Torrey Pines is the host of an annual PGA Tour event, the 2008 U.S. Open, and the IMG Junior Worlds. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd if that isn't enough, consider the excitement of having the \"state am\" at Torrey Pines, just a year prior to the venue hosting its second U.S. Open.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nSo many future stars have been crowned at Torrey Pines during their amateur days that the list reads like a golf history book. If you can win at Torrey Pines, your game will travel.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNone of them dominated the cliffside fairways of the famous South Course at Torrey Pines like Tiger Woods. Counting the younger age brackets, Woods took home six Junior World titles, before winning his first 15-17 age bracket as a fifteen year old, hitting it 50 yards by the older players. He went on to amass eight PGA Tour Farmers Insurance Open titles. And then there was 2008, when he gritted his teeth in pain on a broken knee, and still won the U.S. Open in a playoff over Rocco Mediate.<br><br> \r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px; text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062229.jpg\"><br>2019 champion William Mouw<br>with the Edward B. Tufts trophy</div></div>One can only wonder if Woods would have had his name etched onto the amazing trophy if the California Amateur was held at Torrey Pines. (For the record, Ed Cuff famously beat Woods in the semi-finals in 1994, ending his best run at the title.)<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe California Amateur was originally held at Del Monte GC but shifted to Pebble Beach Golf Links when it was built in 1919. The championship remained at Pebble Beach through 2006, with the exception of 2000 when it was played at Bayonet and Blackhorse GCs due to the U.S. Open. (Remember Tiger's 15-shot victory?) That was also the time and place that a little golf website named <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/\">AmateurGolf.com</a> launched with a gorilla marketing campaign during the Open.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe California Amateur starts with 156 players playing two rounds of stroke play on July 27 and 28 on both the South and North courses at Torrey Pines. A field of 32 golfers who qualify for the match play portion will compete for that title on the South course, from July 29 to August 1.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<B>NORTH COURSE PREVIEW</B><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-courses/CA/La-Jolla/18129/Torrey-Pines-Golf-Club-North-Course\">North Course</a> went from good to great, after a multi-million dollar renovation and remodel under the direction of Tom Weiskopf opened in late 2016, in time for the 2017 Farmers.  <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe nines were reversed, and the par of hole Nos. 17 and 18 (old 8 and 9) changed from finishing 4-5 to finishing 5-4. Weiskopf's argument in making the change is that all of the most scenic oceanfront holes were formerly on the front nine, and he was right. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBeyond adding some length (particularly with some new back tees aimed at Tour players) the biggest change is the overall condition (it plays firmer now) and particularly the green complexes. If you haven't played there since the renovation you'll notice the turf reduction in the form of sandy areas with tufts of grass - they are definitely worth staying out of but most of the time you will be able to recover fine as long as you have a stance and swing.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062250.jpg\"><br>The tee shot on the par-3 15th on the North</div><br>\r\n\r\nThe greens (all with installed \"SubAir\" systems beneath) are fast, firm, and some of them bigger. The aforementioned par-5, No. 17 is now a really good risk/reward hole with the green standing right up against a barranca, Long hitters will have no trouble reaching the green and taking advantage, but it is a daunting shot from farther out.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOn the front nine, the 7th hole can be set up as a reachable par-4 but its green is probably the most controversial of Weiskopf's putting surfaces. A swale as big as a bath tub can send slightly missed shots on the right down a collection area into the rough. But for such an easy hole, it's really not unfair. Besides, when you pitch up to the green from the right side of the fairway -- or from the right rough where many tee balls wind up -- you'll see some creative pitch shot options using a backboard behind the green. It's a fun hole but because the hole isn't part of match play I'm guessing they won't use the forward tee this week. <br><br>\r\n\r\nOverall, the North is going to play easier than the South, as you typically see in the Farmers. But it's no pushover.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-course-reviews/3816/Torrey-Pines-South-Course-Review\">Open for Play: Torrey Pines North Course Review</a><br><br>\r\n\r\n<B>SOUTH COURSE PREVIEW</B><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-courses/CA/La-Jolla/1615/Torrey-Pines-Golf-Club-South-Course\">South Course</a> opens with a firm handshake -- if it was a Covid knuckle-bump your hand would be sore for a few holes. Bunkers left and right off the tee in the landing zone set the tone for much of the round since \"Open Doctor\" Rees Jones redesigned Torrey South -- it's not lost balls or deep rough that causes the most problems off the tee on the South, it's the diabolically positioned fairway bunkers. (Hit 10 of 14 fairways on the South and you've done well.) But the second shot, into the prevailing ocean breeze to a narrow, well-protected green, will really grab your attention. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAgain, the first hole tells you everything you need to know about approach shots into the greens at Torrey Pines South. You know some courses where hitting a drawing 7-iron into a green, maybe missing your target by a few feet and bouncing off the edge of a bunker winds up giving you a five foot putt for birdie? Not so at Torrey South. Balls that miss the mark routinely get rejected like NBA jump shots. And while many of the greenside bunkers are fairly manageable, some -- like the cavern on the right of No. 7, or the church pew bunkers on the par-5 13th, are really penal.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMy favorite hole is No. 4, pictured above. It's a lengthy par-4 guarded by bunkers on the right off the tee, and with just a seemingly tiny patch of rough separating the fairway from the cliff edge. The water isn't in <i>play</i> so much as it's just there in all it's resplendent glory. The play into the green for longer shots is to use the hill on the right, avoiding the small bunker and collection area in front of the green. The little bunker and collection area were a nice change from the previous design, a huge bunker surrounded by patchy rough. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIf one, two, and three didn't capture your attention, No. 4 most certainly did. For the rest of the day, par on any hole will be a good score -- for the long hitters in the field this week, it will be the par-5 holes (Nos. 6, 9, 13, and 18) where you can do the scoring.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAmong the par-4s, No. 12 stands out as one of the toughest perennially on the PGA Tour. Tees that stretch the hole back to over 500 yards and a deep, back-to-font sloping green (with the pacific ocean as a backdrop) demand 100% attention for all 17 minutes you play No. 12, but you can at least take a moment to watch hang gliders taking off from the nearby glider port defy gravity.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStarting with the tough par-3 11th, the back nine never lets up. The tee shot on No. 17 is particularly daunting with trees being removed on the left side - exposing the dangers of the barranca that guards the entire left side.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAvoid \"Devlin's Billabong\" (where Australian legend Bruce Devlin famously rinsed a couple of goes at the green, dashing his chance at the title) on No. 18. Not only does hitting the par-5 green in two require a perfectly judged carry, the water also comes into play for wedge shots, as <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/1005/Kyle-Stanley?p=1\">Kyle Stanley</a> famously found out at the Farmers in 2012. I would expect the California Golf Association to push the tees on No. 18 up at least one day, to allow matches that make it to the last hole to finish with theatrics.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-course-reviews/3816/Torrey-Pines-South-Course-Review\">Torrey Pines South Course Review</a><br><br>\r\n\r\n<B>PAST CHAMPIONS</B><br><br>\r\n\r\nSome of the most famous winners of the California Amateur include San Francisco Bay Area legends Ken Venturi (1951) and Johnny Miller (1968). Bobby Clampett could sleep at home for the short drive to Pebble Beach. He won it twice, in 1978 and 1980. Mark O’Meara made the trip up to Pebble Beach from Mission Viejo, and won the title in 1979. <br><br>\r\n\r\nLets not forget the amateurs, especially friend of the company -- and anyone who has played with him or had him carry for them at Pebble Beach -- professional caddie <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/20147/Casey-Boyns\">Casey Boyns</a>. Boyns has won the title twice, but he's such a humble guy that most of the players he caddies for never even know. (If you are ever lucky enough to have Casey caddie for you - listen to his advice...)<br><br>\r\n\r\nStandout golfers who have tried to win the title and failed, include Craig Stadler, Corey Pavin, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods. Woods reached the semifinals in 1994 before falling to Ed Cuff. The oldest champion remains Vern Callison, who won in 1967 at the age of 47. Mac Hunter is the youngest champion, having won in 1972 at the age of 16.<BR><BR>\r\nSpectators will not be allowed for the medal play portion of the championship on Monday and Tuesday July 27-28. Starting with Wednesday's matches, things open up a bit however attendees should be prepared to follow all San Diego COVID-19 safety protocols.",

Saturday saw our friends North of the border claim a title of their own.\r\n\r\nBrigitte Thibault, a Rosemere, Quebec native and Fresno State senior, defeated UC Davis’ Jackie Lucena 4&3 to claim the Western Women’s Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\nThibault and Lucena exchanged blows early with Thibault gaining no more than a 1 up advantage through the first six holes. After a win on No. 7, Thibault lost holes 8 and 9 to Lucena making the match all square.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“I didn’t want to get my hopes up, because I know my game right now is kind of on a roller coaster,” Thibault told the Women’s Western Golf Association. “I feel like I gained a lot of momentum from yesterday. I just kept the faith. I kept fighting and didn’t give up”\r\n\r\nMaking the turn, Thibault got back in the saddle to regain the lead. Keeping the pace, Thibault won holes 13, 14, and 15 to get the 4&3 victory.\r\n\r\n“I think it was just like a switch,” Thibault said when talking about her front nine struggles. “I had missed a lot on the front, and I could feel how close I was to hitting it really good.”\r\n\r\nThibault joins Maddie Szeryk (2017) as the only Canadians to win the championship in its 120-year history. With the win, Thibault earned an exemption into the U.S. Women's Amateur in December.",

    "articleText": "The 20-year old Cal State Fullerton golfer Sara Camarena kept Katherine Zhu just out of arm's reach with a clutch par on the par-3 18th to win the 54th California Women's Amateur at Pasatiempo Golf Club.\r\n\r\nThe first foreign-born player to win the event, the Mexico City native was also playing in her first non-collegiate event in the state, after transferring to Fullerton from Oklahoma State in the spring. With COVID-19 shutting the season down, Camarena got to play just one event as a Titan.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nTwo holes up with two holes to play, Camarena jeopardized her lead with a triple-bogey on the 17th. In medal play, that kind of score could be disastrous. But in match play, a lead can only be whittled down one hole at a time.\r\n\r\nCamarena, once she saw her opponent tee off on the rare finishing par-3, knew what she had to do. Make sure to hit the green, and force your opponent to hole a birdie putt to extend the match. \r\n\r\n“On the tee on 18, I knew I was still 1-up. She (Zhu) hit a nice shot [to about 9 feet]. I just wanted to be on the safe side,” said Camarena.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes the subconscious mind knows where the pin is, and the body reacts.\r\n\r\nHer choked-up 8-iron off the tee of the on the downhill, 145-yard par 3 headed towards the tucked front-right hole location never left the flag.\r\n\r\n“I wanted to hit a draw but my ball actually just went straight,\" she explained. \"It worked out.”\r\n\r\nWhen Zhu missed her birdie putt, the rest was a formality; even though Camarena missed the birdie putt she wasn't taking any chances on the speedy greens, where even three footers can get away from you.\r\n\r\nHaving never seen Pasatiempo prior to the tournament, Camarena is a big fan of the Alister MacKenzie layout -- one that is open for the public to enjoy.\r\n\r\n“I learned where to hit and where to miss it,” Camarena said. “A big thing for me all week I think was my focus. I would try to relax in between shots. It’s hard to focus the whole time.”",

    "articleText": "We've had today's Sunnehanna Amateur champ <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24499/Preston-Summerhays?p=1\">Preston Summerhays</a> on our radar for quite some time. \r\n\r\nA top performer on the junior level at AJGA and other events, Summerhays catapulted to the status of USGA Champ with a win at the 2019 U.S. Junior Amateur. With that win, he became the third junior golfer to be awarded an exemption to the U.S. Open - so he has that to look forward to in the fall.\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25243/Summerhays-hits--shot-of-a-lifetime--on-way-to-U-S--Junior-win\">Summerhays hits 'shot of a lifetime' on way to U.S. Junior win</a>\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime, there is plenty of learning and growing to do on the golf course, and Summerhays proved that he's capable of winning a major four-round medal play tournament against a field stock full of Division I golfers.\r\n\r\n\"Last year after the U.S. Junior, I made some new goals,\" Summerhays told AmateurGolf.com \"I played really well on the high junior level but I thought a new goal would be to win a big amateur event, something slightly more challenging.\"\r\n\r\nAnd despite the fact that the Arizona State signee didn't <i>need</i> an exemption into the U.S. Amateur at Bandon Dunes this fall, his performance today, and all week, proves Summerhays is one of the players to watch a month from now at Bandon Dunes.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThursday, Summerhays posted a 4-under 66 to vault himself into a solo lead. But the Sunnehanna has one of the top fields in all of amateur golf, and there was no room to do anything but keep charging. \r\n\r\n“I’m just going to keep on playing the way I have been playing,” told the Tribune-Democrat after yesterday's round. “I’m going to attack when I have good numbers with wedges. I’m going to keep practicing my putting and make sure I make those 4 to 8-footers.”\r\n\r\nThe result? A nearly flawless round of 65 at Sunnehanna Country Club with just a single bogey on the fifth hole. His birdie on No. 18 to close out the win is shown below.\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Preston Summerhays birdies No. 18 to win <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SunnehannaAm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SunnehannaAm</a> at a record-tying 14-under <a href=\"https://t.co/M4Tscs8bxZ\">pic.twitter.com/M4Tscs8bxZ</a></p>— Michael Mastovich (@masty81) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/masty81/status/1286739587931439104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 24, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\nSummerhays loved the back nine all week -- posting 33, 32, and 33, but today's 4-under 31 was his best close of the week, and it provided him a three-shot cushion over a charging <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/19009/Travis-Vick?p=1\">Travis Vick</a>.\r\n\r\nThe University of Texas star started the day a full five shots behind Summerhays, but he caught fire today. \r\n\r\nAfter posting 3-under 32 on the front nine, he made the turn and eagled No. 10, then caught three-straight birdies on Nos. 15-17 to move to 8-under on the round, and 12-under on the tournament. A bogey at the last cost Vick the chance to set the bar one shot lower for Summerhays, still on the course, and playing in the final group at 12-under with two holes to play.\r\n\r\n\"I was definitely following it,\" Summerhays said. \"The last leaderboard I saw was on number 12. I think at that point I had a two-shot lead.\"\r\n\r\nBirdies on both of those final holes made it a moot point and Vick could rest knowing that his 63, and a solo second-place finish, was as good finish-wise as a 62 would have been. And if you're wondering what the record is, that's a 61 posted by <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/1933/Zack-Sucher?p=1\">Zack Sucher</a> in 2008. \r\n\r\n\"Because he [Vick] had such a good day, I thought I'd have to birdie at least one of the last two to either win or get into a playoff, so I stayed aggressive on those holes and made some good birdies.\"\r\n\r\nAs for Summerhays, his four rounds in the 60s and birdie-birdie finish are two things he's going to remember for a long time. \r\n\r\nWith the win, Summerhays tied one record and broke another.\r\n\r\nAt just 18 years and 2 days old, he is the youngest winner in tournament history, a title previously held by <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/693/Rickie-Fowler?p=1\">Rickie Fowler</a>, the 2008 champion. And with a tournament total of 14-under, he tied the previous scoring mark held by Allen Doyle.\r\n\r\nThe name Summerhays is legendary in Utah golf -- Preston's teacher (and father) is Boyd Summerhays, who also has Tony Finau under his wing, and is currently caddying for him at the 3M Open on the PGA Tour, where they are contending. To quote Boyd's website:\r\n\r\n\"Golf is in my blood. My grandfather, Pres Summerhays, was the head golf coach at the University of Utah. My father, Lynn, played collegiate golf, and for several years served as President of the Utah Junior Golf Association and on the USGA Committee. My uncle, Bruce Summerhays, is a Champions Tour winner and was also an accomplished golf instructor. His daughter, Carrie, is a former LPGA Tour player. My younger brother, Daniel, has played over 8 seasons on the PGA Tour, reaching as high as 53rd in the world rankings.\"\r\n\r\nWe'll have what they're having.\r\n\r\nLSU star <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22197/Trey-Winstead?p=1\">Trey Winstead</a> finished solo third at 10-under, while <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/17104/Quade-Cummins?p=1\">Quade Cummins</a> (Oklahoma), <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22106/Connor-Schmidt?p=1\">Connor Schmidt</a> (Drexel), and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/15454/Brandon-Mancheno?p=1\">Brandon Mancheno</a> (Auburn) posted 9-under to tie for fourth.

Losing the first playoff hole, Hunt gave way to Norman, Oklahoma native Charlie Jackson.\r\n\r\nHopping into Voegeli’s cart, the duo navigated their way through the Patriot Golf Club, gaining a 3 up advantage through just seven holes.\r\n\r\n“Tyler really is the reason I’m here,” Voegeli told Golf Oklahoma. “He got me started playing again.”\r\n\r\nAlthough down three early, Jackson fought back. Getting it back down to a one-hole lead, Jackson could not stop the putting clinic Voegeli was putting on.\r\n\r\nBeing 2 up with just five holes left, Voegeli’s marathon of two rounds a day for three days finally began to wear on him. Walking off the 13th green, Voegeli told Hunt how tired he was.\r\n\r\n“He [Hunt] told me I wasn’t tired and just needed to make one good swing,” remarked Voegeli.\r\n\r\nHe made more than just one good swing. With 270 yards into the par-5 15th, Voegeli and Hunt ran through their options. Instead of laying up, the duo decided to trust a 20-year-old 3 wood, a club that is older than Voegeli’s opponent who is heading to Abilene Christian next month. Executing the shot to near perfection, Voegeli cleaned up a two-putt for birdie and extended his lead to 3 up with three to go.\r\n\r\n After Jackson delayed his win on 16, Voegeli took the crown on 17 with a birdie to win 3&1.\r\n\r\n“I certainly didn’t expect to win this, but I’ve been playing really well leading up to it and I thought if I just stick to my game plan and execute one shot at a time, I would have a chance to beat anybody,” Voegeli said. “It sounds cliché, but that’s the mindset I had in all six matches.\r\n\r\n“I’m really grateful to Tyler for jumping in and helping me out. I know he was disappointed not to be in the finals. He’s a great friend and really the reason I’m playing golf today.”\r\n\r\nVoegeli is now one for one in Oklahoma’s top amateur event, having never played in it before.",

    "articleText": "Preston Summerhays emerged from a pack of four players tied after 36 holes to take a naroow lead into the final round of Sunnehanna Amateur.\r\n\r\nSummerhays, an Arizona State signee, posted a 4-under 66 to vault himself into a solo lead with one round remaining. Getting off to a hot start, Summerhays carded three birdies on his first four holes before making a bogey on the par-3 fifth. Following the bogey with four-straight pars to close out the front side, Summerhays went out in 33.\r\n\r\nTallying two birdies on the back nine, Summerhays finds himself sleeping on a slim one-shot margin. \r\n\r\n“I’m just going to keep on playing the way I have been playing,” Summerhays, who broke loose from a four-way tie for the lead through two rounds, told the Tribune-Democrat. “I’m going to attack when I have good numbers with wedges. I’m going to keep practicing my putting and make sure I make those 4 to 8-footers.”\r\n\r\nFirst round leader, Oklahoma coach Ryan Hybl, was unable to keep up with the younger players today. Hybl, 38,  got off on the wrong foot, opening his third round with a 4-over 39. Finding a way to save his round, he carded two birdies on the back nine for a 72 which places him into a tie for 15th at 3-under.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nFellow Sooner and day two co-leader Quade Cummins matched his head coach’s score with his own 72 to also slide from the lead.\r\n\r\nThe last of the four day two co-leaders, Auburn’s Graysen Huff finds himself in prime position to strike during the final round. Following his Wednesday 65 with a 3-under 67 on Thursday, Huff sits just one back of Summerhays.\r\n\r\nJoining Huff in second place is Southern Cal’s, Leon D’Souza. Catching fire in the middle part of his round, D’Souza went 5-under over a five-hole stretch (No. 8-12) which included an eagle on the par-5 11th.\r\n\r\nD’Souza made an eagle on the par-5 No. 11 and had birdies on 8, 9, 12 and 17. He made bogey on 14. He told the Tribune-Democrat in a post round interview that it was a long putt for birdie that really got him going.\r\n\r\n“Definitely the birdie on No. 8, that was 42 feet,” D’Souza said of the hole that helped spark his round. “I had made seven pars in a row until that. That pushed me in the right direction. I made an eagle on 11 and birdied 12.\"\r\n\r\nTrey Winstead sits in solo fourth at 7-under, three competitors are tied for fifth at 5-under. The final group of Summerhays, Huff, and D’Souza tee off at 9:30 am ET.",

The club's first nine holes designed by Ross opened for play in 1913, while the club itself dates back to 1895.

And in 2021 Maridoe will host its first USGA championship, the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/7038/U-S--Women-s-Amateur-Four-Ball-Championship\">U.S. Women's Four-Ball</a>.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062218.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\nAmateurGolf.com writer Brayden Conover got the opportunity to sit down with Huddleston to discuss what the club means to him and what its plans are for its future.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Q: How did Maridoe come about?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nA: I was fortunate to be raised in a golf family in Eastern Tennessee and my father was quite a great player. So all my life I was around great play and I’d carry double staff bags at <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-courses/TN/Alcoa/26420/Green-Meadow-Country-Club\">Green Meadow Country Club</a> in Maryville, Tennessee at five dollars a bag. Everything was golf-centric for us. My father when I was 13, with two friends, built a golf course called <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-courses/TN/Knoxville/26407/Fox-Den-Country-Club\">Fox Den</a> in Knoxville, Tennessee to have a place for his friends. I thought that was one of the greatest things I’d ever experienced.<br><br>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, my father had cancer at a young age and died, but I always said at some point in time if I have the resources and the opportunity I would like very much to be responsible for creating a Walt Disney sandbox for golf for your friends. So I tried for 20 years to find the right place to do it and every time I tried to buy something it wasn’t for sale or I didn’t get there in time. But the good Lord had something better for me which was this property.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn January of 2014, I was able to purchase it right in the middle of Dallas, Texas. Largest private lake in Dallas County. Water is a big thing in Texas. So a good friend of mine, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/7365/Steve-Smyers?p=1\">Steve Smyers</a> -- I’ve always admired him for what he had done at <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-courses/IN/Zionsville/5584/Wolf-Run-Golf-Club\">Wolf Run</a> in Zionsville, Indiana. I wanted an architect that would allow me to be collaborative. The idea was to create a championship golf course on which regardless of your handicap, you’d have a good time if you put your ego in the right place. So I call him up about working with me on this. I wanted to be able to share my ideas because when I was in second grade I was creating fantasy golf holes. Everyone at some point likes to act on their fantasies. That’s what Maridoe represents to me personally.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062219.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Q: What was your thought process behind the MSFI’s?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nA: I was out here and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/19912/Martin-Flores?p=1\">Martin Flores</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/8190/Jordan-Spieth?p=1\">Jordan Spieth</a> had just finished playing. I saw them and said ‘hey guys, how y’all doing? By the way, is this the longest you’ve ever gone without playing in a tournament?’ and one of them said ‘Well gosh, yeah since I was six years old.’ Well, I thought that was kind of silly so I came back in and told Alison Morrison (the managing member at Maridoe) ‘We need to have a tournament. It’s not right that these sharp blades aren’t out here practicing and playing.’ The COVID protocol is something that can be very very seriously adhered to and taken very seriously. Golf is one of the few sports if any in which the protocol necessary for safety can be accomplished. So we said ‘let’s just do it’. <br><br>\r\n\r\nWe were just going to do it for our own people and then we decided to have the Maridoe Samaritan Fund and have people pay a little bit of an entry fee [to benefit] the caddies and some of the people that have physical problems. It spread like wildfire so all the people began talking to other people and they’re all very hungry to play. When <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/14160/Viktor-Hovland?p=1\">Viktor [Hovland]</a> was on his way back to Oklahoma, he told Alison ‘let’s do it again’. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nSo literally within 24-hours of finishing Samaritan 1.0, we [plan] 2.0. We again adhered to all the protocols. The first time we had spacers and you couldn’t touch the pins. The second time we got a little more lenient. <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/14761/Brandon-Wu?p=1\">Brandon Wu</a> went 3-under on the last five holes to win that tournament.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThen the juniors say ‘Hey Mr. Huddleston, we have nowhere to play. Can you do something for us?’ and I’m a big proponent of junior golf so I said ‘Why not?’ so we created the Maridoe Junior Invitational.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWe did not do it to get any notoriety. We did it because we felt it was the right thing to do and we could do it… It goes to show you that if you just do the right thing, good things come out of doing the right thing for the right reasons.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062220.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Q: What kind of player does Maridoe favor?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nA: Maridoe was designed to identify a player that can fly the ball and work the ball, rather than the mono-dimensional players being created that swing it as hard as they can and launch it straight up in the air. You can’t make a course too long for them so you want to make a course that is strategically interesting and if you can’t flight the ball, if you can’t dead-hands the ball, you can’t work the ball, then you’ll come up on the short end.<br><br>\r\n\r\nI always tell people that if you take a great player that’s mono-dimensional and can only hit it hard and high and you take a great player that can flight the ball, work the ball, that individual will own the other person’s car, house, mom’s house, their shoes because every hole on purpose changes orientation. You have to reset your subconscious on how you’re strategically going to attack the golf hole. If you leave your brain in the parking lot, you have no chance whatsoever. For people that have a sharp blade in golf, I wanted to make a place that would make a sharp blade sharper. When you leave this property you’re not intimidated.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062221.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Q: What is the future of Maridoe?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nA: Maridoe is created to host anything that is attractive in golf. What I didn’t want to have happen is if someone said ‘You could host a certain tournament and we’d love to have it there, but had you this…’ I did not want that to be the case so I wanted to create a golf course in which there is no reason you couldn’t host anything here, of any level of competition. The golf course in itself is so flexible. There are so many tees, and the wind changes, and you can push and pull the golf course.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMy view is I like short par threes which you have here. Everyone’s going for length and you can’t out-length these guys and also you cut off three-fourths of most of the people playing by just doing that (over-lengthening the golf course). Maridoe has a mixture of short/long holes; you can push and pull it. My favorite thing about Maridoe, and it was done purposefully: I want a great player to periodically be terribly uncomfortable because there’s an awkward shot ahead of them. And also, the second shots on par fives traditionally are mindless layups, but not here. The drive is not that hard, but the second-shots are typically awkward. Awkward breeds indecision and indecision will breed mistakes.<br><br>\r\n\r\nI also consider the great young players. I want them to inadvertently use what I would call ‘excessive greed’ to bury themselves. The buffalo grass rough, although not very long, generates tremendous flier lies. You’re never comfortable and confident in how far the ball may go, again creating awkwardness, indecision, uncertainty. I think that separates the best in all categories.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt really separates the richest cream from cream, the ones who can think their way around the course. If you get out of position don’t be a hero. We bury heroes here. No headstones, but they’re out there. It’s not a mindless game at Maridoe.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMy view is very simple. You’re supposed to have fun. I think Maridoe is very demanding but fair.",

    "articleText": "Richard Kerper (Oldsmar, Fla.) shot a bogey-free 4-under 68 to come from five shots back and win the Society of Seniors (SOS) Jack Hesler Tournament at Two Rivers Country Club in Williamsburg, Va.\r\n\r\nPlaying with overnight leader Jimmy Jones (Tampa, Fla.), Kerper started chipping into the lead early, picking up a shot on each of the first two holes and getting within one with a birdie at the par-4 6th.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nWhen Jones double-bogeyed the par-5 9th hole, Kerper suddenly had a a share of the lead, a lead he took outright with a two-shot swing on the par-4 11th. After another bogey on the par-3 13th, Jones found his game and made three straight birdies to tie it back up with two holes to go. But a bogey at the par-3 17th proved decisive as Kerper parred in for a one-shot win.\r\n\r\nKerper finished at 7-under 209, while Jones closed with a 74 to finish at 6 under.\r\n\r\nRobert Funk of Canyon Lake, Calif. shot a 68 of his own to climb into third place at 5 under, while Allen Peake (71) and Keith Decker (69) rounded out the top five.\r\n\r\nThe SOS Jack Hesler was the first national senior tournament played since the COVID-19 pandemic put a temporary halt to amateur golf this spring. Four months had passed since the nation's top seniors last got together, at the Florida Azalea Senior in March.\r\n\r\nDon Donatoni (Malvern, Pa.) won the Super Senior division at 2-under 214, four shots clear of Evan Long (Charlotte, N.C.).

    "articleText": "Moving day was executed to near perfection for Georgia’s Will Chandler.\r\n\r\nStarting the day 3-under, Chandler took advantage of prime conditions at the Country Club of Columbus. Two strokes back of round one leaders Colin Bowles and Bryce Lewis, Chandler quickly made it up, beginning his second round with back-to-back birdies on No. 1 and 2.\r\n\r\nMaking the turn three shots better than he did on Tuesday, Chandler was simply in the zone as he started the back nine. Catching fire, Chandler birdied four straight holes (11-14) and adding another on his final hole of the day to post a back nine 29.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nFlirting with the course record of 61 set in the third round of last year’s Southeastern Amateur by defending champ and CCC member Ben Carr, Chandler’s 62 allows Carr to sleep a bit easier.\r\n\r\nThe bogey-less second round vaulted Chandler into first place with 18-holes left to crown the 2020 Southeastern champion. Round one leaders Bowles and Lewis once again matched each other with 67s, finding themselves primed for the 18-hole sprint alongside Georgia Tech’s Connor Howe who posted a 65 on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nHowe and Lewis will be paired with Chandler for Thursday’s final round as they will tee off at 12:20 pm ET. Bowles (-8), Alex Goff (-7) (Kentucky), and Nicholas Infanti (-7) (North Florida) are all within earshot of the lead and will be one group ahead of Chandler and company.\r\n\r\nDefending champ Ben Carr (Georgia Southern) is five off the lead at 6-under and will tee off at 11:50 am ET.\r\n\r\nNormally a 72-hole event, the Southeastern cut the event one round short to accommodate for COVID-19. No cut was instituted for this year’s championship.\r\n\r\n",

Phil Murphy on Tuesday added the golfer's home state of Virginia onto a list of 31 states that require a 14-day quarantine due to the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nGolfers making the cut to Wednesday's final round are required to withdraw if in the past two weeks they have visited states added to the list: Alaska, Delaware, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Virginia, and Washington.\r\n\r\n\"A very difficult decision for us to make, but the decision already has been made,\" Kevin Purcell, executive director of the New Jersey State Golf Association, said late Tuesday afternoon. \"The policy was in place, and there's already been people who have withdrawn from the event because they had played in the states that had been on the list at that time.\"\r\n\r\nHall, a pro at Upper Montclair, shot 5-under-par 67 during Tuesday's second round at Knickerbocker Country Club and stood at 7-under 137. Muehr, who plays out of Pine Valley and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25650/Michael-Muehr-wins-his-third-Crump-Cup-title\">won his third Crump Cup title there last fall</a>, shot a second consecutive 69 and was one shot back at 138.\r\n\r\nMuehr, a former pro, and last year's State Open runner-up was notified via phone of the withdrawal a couple of hours after completing his round.\r\n\r\n\"The timing was bad,\" Muehr told AmateurGolf.com. \"If it happened a day later, I'm good.\r\n\r\n\"I totally acknowledge and respect that [the NJGA's decision]. It was an easy decision. I wasn't going to fight it.\"\r\n\r\nHall will shoot for his third State Open title. Hall, 38, won in 2015 and 2016 and was runner-up in 2018. He holds a one-shot lead over amateur Mark Costanza of Hamilton Farm, who shot a tournament-best 65 for 138. They will tee off in Wednesday's final twosome at 8:40 a.m.\r\n\r\n“Fortunately, I’ve been in this spot a few times,” Hall said a couple of hours before news of Muehr's withdrawal. “so I kind of know how to handle it.”\r\n\r\nIn his first event back since September, Muehr had an interesting scorecard – how many golfers have more eagles than birdies? He had two eagles, one birdie and two bogeys for his second consecutive 69. He eagled the par-5 10th and the par-5 18th, closing by sinking a downhill 20-footer.\r\n\r\nMuehr made the tournament officials DQ him rather than withdrawing, saying \"I did make sure I let them know 'You guys have to DQ me. I'm not WD'ing'.'\" \r\n\r\nMuehr's disqualification was reminiscent of what happened to Ben James of Connecticut, who earlier this month was unable to defend his state junior title after <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26164/COVID-19-quarantine-keeps-James-from-defending-state-junior-title\">being forced to withdraw</a> by a similar COVID-19 quarantine.",

With three birdies on the front nine, Hybl found comfort in the course as he has over the years. Carding an eagle on the par-5 11th, Hybl was able to negate two bogeys he had on the backside to go along with back-to-back birdies on holes 15 and 16.\r\n\r\nHybl knocked off the dust last week at the Southern Amateur at Maridoe. Missing the cut (+9), Hybl was just happy to get back to tournament golf after a six-year hiatus.\r\n\r\nLSU’s Trey Winstead and Notre Dame’s Palmer Jackson will be a part of a handful of groups looking to complete the last few holes of their first rounds Wednesday morning.

Other past champs include Rickie Fowler (2007-2008), Webb Simpson (2006), Lucas Glover (2001), Scott Verplank (1984-1985), and Ben Crenshaw (1973).\r\n\r\nThe Sunnehanna has long drawn the top mid-amateurs, many of whom -- Jay Sigel, Allen Doyle, John Harris, Duke Delcher and others -- have lifted the trophy.\r\n\r\nFour-time U.S. Mid-Amateur champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/777/Nathan-Smith?p=1\">Nathan Smith</a> is the only past Sunnehanna champion in the mid-amateur ranks this year, but many of the best of the 25-and-older set are in the field, including former U.S. Mid-Amateur champ <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/6046/Stewart-Hagestad?p=1\">Stewart Hagestad</a>, the reigning Western Amateur champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/52007/Garrett-Rank\">Garrett Rank</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/16012/Joseph-Deraney\">Joe Deraney</a>, and former U.S. Senior champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/43848/Sean-Knapp\">Sean Knapp</a>.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThere will be a new champion this year, as back-to-back winner <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/17554/Alex-Smalley?p=1\">Alex Smalley</a> of Duke has turned professional.\r\n\r\nSunnehanna Amateur co-Chairman John Yerger is grateful to be able to continue the storied event while earning the unofficial ‘elite’ designation by the USGA with the exemptions awarded to the tournament winner and runner(s) up.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think there’s any question at all it enhances the reputation of these events,” Yeager told AmateurGolf.com back in June. “They [the USGA] not only wanted to incentivize these tournaments to be played, but I also think that the other thing they wanted to do was to award these committees for taking the initiative to try to pursue having these championships.”\r\n\r\n<b>COVID precautions</b>\r\n\r\nNo spectators are being allowed, and everyone entering the property is instructed to check in at a health screening tent. Each player must have his temperature taken and fill out a health questionnaire prior to each round.\r\n\r\nOther precautions include:\r\n\r\n- Players may not arrive earlier than 90 minutes before their scheduled tee time and are requested to leave as soon as possible after concluding a round.\r\n\r\n- No caddies will be permitted except for family members.\r\n\r\n- Masks are required indoors, and encouraged but not mandatory outdoors.\r\n\r\n“Parents and players are very appreciative of what’s being done,” said Yerger to Mike Mastovich of the Tribune-Democrat. “The protocols we have in place have been very successful. We’re really pleased. The players have assumed a lot of responsibility.”",

Tom and Tom Kite Jr.; Arthur and Scott Hoch; Rod and Steve Spittle; Kelly and Blair Miller have graced the trophy over the years.\r\n\r\n“My Dad passed away a few years ago but I still have the trophies in my study,” said the 1992 U.S. Open champion Kite. “They kind of look like water pitchers not like the trophies of today.”\r\n\r\nThis year’s event will not have just one but two former U.S Senior Amateur champions in the field. <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/33392/Paul-Simson\">Paul Simson</a>, a 29-time champion of Carolinas Golf Association events including two Carolinas Amateur titles, was a late addition to the field.

We’ll see. I’m excited to go play there.”\r\n\r\nUSC assistant coach Katie Mitchell is confident that Ruffels will be comfortable playing the same tees as the men.\r\n\r\n“She plays a ton of golf with our men’s team and her brother and she’s very comfortable playing side-by-side with men,” said Mitchell to Smits. “She hits it a long way, hits her irons well and loves firm and fast courses. She won’t be intimidated at all.”\r\n\r\nMouton won the 2019 JAGA First Coast Women’s Amateur at Eagle Harbor Golf Club in Fleming Island. She will begin her junior year at The Bolles School in Jacksonville next month.\r\n\r\nStevens was awarded a JAGA scholarship last month and in August is bound for Flagler College in St. Augustine where she will play golf for the Saints. She is a regular at Jax Beach Golf Club.\r\n\r\nThe championship features 84 entries, 15 of which are in a category which accepts entries from outside JAGA’s Northeast Florida footprint. The 15 hail from all over the state of Florida, and Georgia and Illinois, plus Australia and Ecuador.\r\n\r\nThe field was increased from 78 to 84 last week due to significant demand and a growing alternates list and host Jax Beach Golf Club’s reputation as a faster-playing golf course.\r\n\r\nContestants range in age from 16 to 66.\r\n\r\nPast champions <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/1956/David-Anthony?p=1\">David Anthony</a> (2006) and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/1691/Duke-Butler-IV?p=1\">Duke Butler IV</a> (2009) will join Batchelor at Jax Beach, all in pursuit of their second Amateur title.\r\n\r\nThe North Florida Junior Golf Foundation will be represented via its two exemptions extended to Andrew Davis of Fleming Island, Fla. and Cody Carroll of Jacksonville who plays for Coach Scott Schroeder and Batchelor at UNF.\r\n\r\nHandicap index eligibility is limited to six.

    "articleText": "Loyola (Maryland) sophomore Carlo Pizzano held off McClure Thompson in a playoff to win the 2nd annual Savannah Quarters Invitational at The Club at Savannah Quarters in Pooler, Ga.\r\n\r\nThompson was trying to become the second \"McClure\" of the weekend to win a big tournament. McClure Meissner took home the Southern Amateur Championship at Maridoe in a playoff, but Thompson could not quite match the feat.\r\n\r\nSharing a one-shot overnight lead, Thompson and Pizzano were paired together in the final round. Thompson posted an opening 2-under 70 and a 6-under 66 while Pizzano opened with a 66 and followed it up with a 70 of his own.\r\n\r\nThe pair had an eventful final 18. Pizzano took an early lead but fell behind by two with a double-bogey and a bogey on holes No. 8 and 9. Thompson was up and down, with three birdies and three bogeys to turn at even-par 36. \r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nBoth players elevated their games on the back nine, with Pizzano going four under and Thompson three under to put Thompson one shot up on the 18th tee at 11 under.\r\n\r\nPerhaps feeling the pressure, Thompson came away with a bogey, and the two made their way back to the 18th tee, each having shot 2-under 70.\r\n\r\nBoth making pars on the first playoff hole (No. 18), Pizzano called 'game' on No. 1.\r\n\r\nPlaying aggressively, Pizzano nearly holed out from the fairway as his ball came to rest just inches from the pin. Thompson, needing a birdie to extend the match, could not do so, giving Pizzano the crown as the second winner of the SQI.\r\n\r\nAlex Locke (68) and Sam Sikes (70) shared third at 8 under, two shots out of the playoff. Walker Jones (70), Alex Doss (69) and Owen Burt (71) tied for fifth at 7 under.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062114.jpg\"></div></div>The shot of the tournament was struck by Blaise Vanitvelt, who aced the 314-yard par-4 11th hole in the final round en route to a 70.\r\n\r\nDefending club champion and inaugural Savannah Quarters champ, Joey Kalbac, could not muster the same magic he had last year as he finished T-55 at 14-over-par.\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26074/Savannah-Quarters-champ-Kalbac-hopes-to-put-tourney-on-the-map\">Savannah Quarters champ Kalbac hopes to put tourney on the map</a>",

The Texas Tech junior began the final round five shots back of Pittman. Tallying a 67, Jansen was a double-bogey and a bogey on 18 away from at least forcing a playoff against Pittman. Unable to stay mistake-free, Smith will settle for a runner-up finish at 210.\r\n\r\nClosing out the top-5 in the championship division were Michael Heidelbaugh (212), Robert Johnson (214), Collin Clark (214), and Bryce Waters (214).\r\n\r\nIn the senior division, former Texas Senior Amateur champion Lewis Stephenson came from seven shots back in the final round with a 66 to win by two shots.\r\n\r\nIn the super senior division, Doug Hopton-Jones successfully defended his 2019 West Texas Amateur title. It is his third West Texas Amateur win (2019, 2002).\r\n\r\nIt was a hot week in San Angelo, with temperatures in the mid-90s and only a little wind blowing across Bentwood Coutnry Club.",

    "teaser": "Jamie Lukowicz holds off the defending champion Andrew O'Leary at the 35th hole at Pawtucket Country Club",
    "articleText": "Every athlete dreams of coming through in the clutch when everything is on the line.\r\n\r\nA game-winning shot, a last-second touchdown. In golf, it is a putt to win a tournament.\r\n\r\nJamie Lukowicz stepped up to an 18-footer on hole No. 35 (par 4, 434 yards) the 17th at Pawtucket Country Club (par 69, 6,420 yards) to win the 115th Rhode Island Golf Association Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHe and his caddie Rob Grossguth, a 2003 Finalist, read the putt perfectly and he rolled it in the center. And when that putt reached the bottom of the cup, he put himself in his position to get the missing notch in his belt.\r\n\r\n“The putt was downhill, and I didn’t want to roll it four feet by,” said Lukowicz, 46, of Newport. “I knew exactly where I stood. I read it to break a little left to start and to the right at the end. It rolled it in dead center.”\r\n\r\nThe host club’s Andrew O’Leary still had a 15-footer to extend the match but was unable to respond. \r\n\r\nNo. 3 seed Lukowicz, aided by a brilliant tee-to-green game and a hot putter, claimed the 115th #RIAmateur at Pawtucket in Saturday’s 36-hole Final with a 2&1 victory over defending champion and No. 1 seed O’Leary.\r\n\r\nLukowicz hit his tee shot in the right trees on No. 35 and drew a break because he had a shot to the green. He said his 8-iron from 165 yards came out of the rough hot but held the green.\r\n\r\n“I had no desire to play hole No. 36 (No. 18) (par 4, 379 yards),” said Lukowicz. “It was a great feeling to win it on hole No. 35. Andrew is a great player and a great kid.”\r\n\r\n“That putt Jamie made to win was the story of the day,” said O’Leary, 20, of Norfolk, Mass. “Jamie made a lot of nice putts today and I didn’t.\r\n\r\n“I was hitting the ball well on the range and was loose. I hit the ball solid all day. I didn’t have much fear when hitting my approach shots. I left a few putts short or I just missed them. My speed on the greens is usually good. You aren’t going to putt well the whole week and I didn’t have it at the right time.”\r\n\r\nLukowicz, a Finalist in 2017 at Valley Country Club, said on Friday he needed to come out and make birdies to beat O’Leary.\r\n\r\nHe did just that.\r\n\r\nIn the morning 18, Lukowicz shot 67 to O’Leary’s 69. He made three birdies to O’Leary’s one.\r\n\r\nHe closed out that 67 in style on No. 18 with a 20-footer after O’Leary made a 30-footer for par. A huge momentum boost heading into the afternoon being 2-up instead of 1-up.\r\n\r\nAfter he and O’Leary each had two wins on Nos.19-23, he still stood 2-up. But then he made three consecutive birdies on Nos. 24 (No. 6) (par 4, 414 yards), 25 (No. 7) (par 3, 173 yards) and 26 (No. 8) (par 5, 542 yards). O’Leary birdied two of them, but it moved him to 3-up with 10 holes to play.\r\n\r\n“You don’t think about how many birdies you have made in a row,” said Lukowicz, of Agawam Hunt. “You are trying to make one after the other. I was trying to get up as many holes as I could.”\r\n\r\nThe shot of the day for Lukowicz came on hole No. 25. He nearly aced it with a 7-iron and his birdie was conceded. Putting him in firm control of the match with the sun beating down on the both of them and their energy draining hole-by-hole.\r\n\r\nHe then converted a pressure-packed 4-footer on No. 26 to halve in birdie. He raced his first putt a little by and had to clean up after reaching the par 5 in two.\r\n\r\n“In these types of situations, you tend to get a little quick and want to rush,” said Lukowicz. “But Rob [Grossguth] told me to be patient and I did that. It was good to be ahead in this match as opposed to having to come from behind against Billy [Forcier] in the 2017 Final.\r\n\r\nThey halved Nos. 26-30 in par and O’Leary won Nos. 32 (No. 14) (par 4, 414 yards) and 34 (No. 16) (par 4, 432 yards) with birdies and was knocking on the door until Lukowicz shut it with that 18-footer on No. 35.\r\n\r\nO’Leary had a chance to make history through a few different avenues. He was looking to become the 13th player in the history of the event to win at least two-consecutive titles. The last time was Brad Valois in 2006-07.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHe also was looking to win at his home club. The last player to do that was Mike Soucy at Metacomet Golf Club in 2001.\r\n\r\nBut what he’s done in his first two appearances in the #RIAmateur can’t be overlooked.\r\n\r\nHe was the qualifying medalist both years and won his first nine matches before falling to Lukowicz Saturday.\r\n\r\n“This run I have had in this tournament has been a lot of fun,” said O’Leary, a rising junior at the University of Notre Dame. “Especially playing that year at Shelter Harbor and this year at my home club. I was happy to play well the last two years and I hope I can continue to make a run in this tournament for years to come.”\r\n\r\nLukowicz has won RIGA majors before. He won the Stroke Play in 2018, the John Burke (Gross) in 2018 and the Mid-Amateur in 2014 and 2015. \r\n\r\nBut saying you are the Rhode Island Amateur champion has a different ring to it.\r\n\r\n“There’s so many great players in the history of this tournament that have won it,” said Lukowicz. “Hard work and practice pay off. I grind hard on my wedges and my putting. I hit a lot of balls.”\r\n\r\nHe played the 35 holes in 4 under, 33 of them were flawless.\r\n\r\n“Under the circumstances, this is the best golf I have ever played,” said Lukowicz. “I am proud of myself. I have come a long way.”",

    "teaser": "Mark Lawrence is the 2nd player to win the Virginia state junior, amateur and open titles; the other is a World Golf Hall of Famer",
    "articleText": "By Chris Lang\r\n\r\nMark Lawrence Jr.’s historic blitz of Ballyhack Golf Club came to an end on Saturday afternoon with a tap-in for par at 18, giving him a three-day total of 200 and the championship at the Delta Dental State Open of Virginia. The victory was a long time coming for an accomplished amateur who has been agonizingly close to holding the Farmington Cup twice in the last five years.\r\n\r\nRichmond’s Lawrence, a member at Independence Golf Club who is set to complete his college golf career at Virginia Tech whenever the pandemic will allow, opened with a 9-under-par 63 on Thursday and never let anyone have a realistic hope of catching him. His steady 3-under 69 on Saturday left him with a place in the State Open record book, at least for the seven events held at Ballyhack.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHe shattered the previous low score of 204, set by Fielding Brewbaker and current PGA Tour member Lanto Griffin. His opening round tied his own Ballyhack competitive course record (also shared by Ballyhack member Justin Young, who shot a three-day 207 to finish second this week.) And he became the second member of an ultra-exclusive club of players who have won the State Open, VSGA Amateur and VSGA Junior Stroke Play championships.\r\n\r\nThe other? World Golf Hall of Famer Lanny Wadkins.\r\n\r\n“I’ll have to mention that to Bobby the next time I see him at Kinloch,” Lawrence joked, referring to Wadkins’ brother.\r\n\r\nTo anyone who has played with Lawrence lately, this week’s showing came of little surprise.\r\n\r\n“I played with him in the practice round, and I think everybody in our group saw this coming,” said Mikey Moyers, who shot a three-day 208 to finish third. “We were like, if he hits it like this, we have no chance. He hits hit higher and farther than all of us. There are certain shots you have to hit here high and with spin, and he can do that.\r\n\r\n“He was just playing a different game.”\r\n\r\nLawrence led by four strokes after Thursday and seven strokes when Friday’s suspended second round was completed early Saturday morning. His lead never dipped below four strokes in the final round. His bogey on No. 3 opened the door just a tiny crack, but he made key birdies on Nos. 5, 9 and 11 to slam it shut once again.\r\n\r\nLoving Ballyhack hasn’t always been easy for Lawrence, who in 2014 shared his displeasure of the track on social media after a few tough rounds in his first appearance at the course.\r\n\r\n“When I was 14, you know, I thought you hit driver on every hole, I thought you went at every flagstick, I thought you went at every putt. I was just dumb,” Lawrence said. “Honestly, this course has taught me a lot about how to play golf, and I feel like I get a little bit better every year that I come here and play. It’s about learning how to attack and approach a golf course instead of just bombing driver all day. And it’s honestly become one of my favorite golf courses.\r\n\r\n“It’s funny, I hit two drivers today. In 2014, I bet you I hit seven. I was just dumb. You can’t do that.”\r\n\r\nBecause of the tone set Thursday, the field’s only chance of rallying involved Lawrence backing up over the event’s next two days. With only two bogeys over the course of 54 holes, that opportunity never materialized.\r\n\r\n“He’s too good of a player not to win,” Young said. “He just has a different game than everybody else. He’s always played well here. For him to win, it’s really no surprise. He’s been very close. Now for him to finally get the win, my hat’s off to him.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nJohn O’Leary, PGA, of Trump National Golf Club in Potomac Falls, earned low professional honors with a three-day 209 and finished fourth overall. After struggling to a 74 on Thursday, a round that included a few “rough Ballyhack bounces,” he said, O’Leary switched putters for the final two rounds and returned 69 and 66 to finish a shot clear of Roanoke’s Michael Wade.\r\n\r\n“I really hit my irons decent, and that gave me some good looks,” O’Leary said of his Saturday 66. “I had a couple of key up and downs that really kept my round going.”\r\n\r\nNext up for O’Leary is a trip to the PGA Championship at Harding Park Aug. 6-9. He earned his way into the field by finishing in the top 20 of the 2019 PGA Player of the Year list. O’Leary will be one of 18 club professionals to compete in the event.\r\n\r\nWade and Forest amateur Marshall Tinsley (Winton Farm) finished tied for fifth at 210. Tinsley is the reigning VSGA Mid-Amateur champion.",

    "teaser": "Rachel Kuehn goes overtime in both matches on Saturday to earn the Putter Boy trophy at Pinehurst",
    "articleText": "By Stan Cole\r\n\r\nIt’s only fitting that an extra hole was required Saturday afternoon to decide the 118th Women’s North & South Amateur at Pinehurst No. 2.\r\n\r\nBoth finalists <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/25625/Rachel-Kuehn?p=1\">Rachel Kuehn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/9536/Allisen-Corpuz?p=1\">Allisen Corpuz</a> needed playoffs to reach Saturday afternoon’s final. Kuehn went 20 holes in her quarterfinal victory Friday afternoon while Corpuz had to play 21 before outlasting <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22853/Ivy-Shepherd?p=1\">Ivy Shepherd</a> in Saturday morning’s semifinal.\r\n\r\nToss in an 80-minute rain delay and Saturday’s play extended nearly 11 hours from the time Corpuz first teed off at 7:00 a.m.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nA par on the first playoff hole – the par-4 1st – gave Kuehn the North & South title and Putter Boy trophy 25 years after her mother, former Wake Forest Hall of Famer <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/2965/Brenda-Kuehn?p=1\">Brenda Corrie Kuehn</a>, finished just short of the championship in the 1995 event.\r\n\r\n“I joke with my mom because she finished (short), and has been holding that over my head,” said Kuehn with a laugh.  “I’m glad I could top her a little bit, but to add my name to the list of winners here is an unbelievable feeling.”\r\n\r\nWhile Kuehn had to play five fewer holes to reach the final, the tight competition combined with North Carolina Sandhills summer time weather extended the day.\r\n\r\n“The Pinehurst heat and more than 36 holes definitely makes it a game of endurance, especially when you’re playing two matches in a day,” said Kuehn, who earned All-America honors as a freshman at Wake Forest where she <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25594/Wake-Forest-leans-on-freshmen-in-taking-Annika-Invite-title\">won the prestigious ANNIKA Invitational</a> last September in her first collegiate start.\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Allisen Corpuz and Rachel Kuehn will both receive invites from the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USGA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@USGA</a> into this year’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/USWomensAmateur?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#USWomensAmateur</a>. <a href=\"https://t.co/NmeVtnQqYt\">pic.twitter.com/NmeVtnQqYt</a></p>— Pinehurst Resort (@PinehurstResort) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PinehurstResort/status/1284628370731552768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 18, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\nTwice before Saturday’s weather delay, Kuehn took two-hole leads only to see Corpuz pull square after 11.  After her 21-hole outing in the morning, Corpuz bogeyed the opening two holes of the final round before making five-straight pars – the third of which leveled the match through five.\r\n\r\nKuehn went back in front with a par on the long par-4 eighth; then the Asheville native rolled in a 10-footer on the par-3 ninth for the first birdie by either player of the afternoon.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Wake Forest sophomore left her next two tee shots in the right native area and lost the lead as Corpuz made two straight pars.  On the par-4 12th, Kuehn again left her drive in the right side natural area, but hit the green with her second shot to match Corpuz’ par.\r\n\r\nAs the golfers approached the 13th tee just after 3 p.m., play was halted as thunderstorms moved through the Sandhills region.\r\n\r\nNeither Kuehn nor Corpuz appeared to be affected by the delay as both hit the fairway, then took aim at the elevated green with their second shots on the par-4 13th.  However, Corpuz missed a 3-footer for par to drop the hole.\r\n\r\nThe Southern Cal senior rallied and closed the round with five straight pars, including a long two-putt on 17.  Kuehn just missed her par putt on the hole and the competitors stepped to the 18th tee all square.  Each hit fairway, green and two-putted to send the match to the playoff.\r\n\r\nCorpuz’ drive on her 40th hole of the day found the left native area and her footing was unsure as the native of Kapolei, Hawaii, set up for her second shot.  Corpuz’ hybrid bounced off the back of the green; then her chip was short and rolled off the slope.\r\n\r\nKuehn then two-putted from the front fringe to secure the title.\r\n\r\nThe delay might have come at an opportune time for Kuehn.\r\n\r\n“I actually wasn’t hitting the ball great going into the rain delay, so it gave me a chance to regroup and it kind of turned an 18-hole final match into a six-hole final match.”\r\n\r\nCorpuz, the 2019 North & South medalist who advanced to the quarterfinals of the event in the last two years, noted that the delay was “a little annoying to take a break, but it happens and you have to accept it and keep playing.”\r\n\r\nBoth Corpuz and Kuehn entered the Women’s North & South Amateur as qualifiers for the U.S. Women’s Amateur, which will be played Aug. 3-9 at Woodmont Country Club in Maryland.\r\n\r\n“I’m so proud of her play. She just never quits. She has a fire in her belly that never ends and you can never count her out because she’ll fight to the last drop,” said Brenda Corrie Kuehn, who competed in 16 U.S. Amateurs and nine U.S. Opens.\r\n\r\nEven with her vast golfing experience, Brenda allowed Rachel and her veteran Pinehurst caddie Keith Silva handle matters on the course.  Silva was on the bag at Pinehurst last year for <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22979/William-Holcomb?p=1\">William Holcomb V</a>’s run to the U.S. Amateur semifinal and two weeks ago as Holcomb finished as runner-up in the North & South.\r\n\r\n“We talked about things that were not golf. This was about (Rachel) and her caddie,” said Brenda. “The two of them made a great team.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n<b>Semifinals</b>\r\n\r\nCorpuz advanced to the final after making a 12-foot birdie putt on the 21st hole Saturday morning.  After she and Ivy Shepherd both saved par from the native area on the first two playoff holes, Corpuz hit a wedge from 105 yards to 12 feet to set up the deciding birdie on the short par-4 third hole.\r\n\r\nShepherd, the North & South medalist, made the turn Saturday morning 1-up, but the Corpuz tied the match three times on the back nine – the last with short par putt on the par-three 17th.\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t hitting the ball really well today; I was just trying to keep it in play and grind it out,” said Shepherd, a sophomore at Clemson. “I just missed a few important putts coming down the road. When it went to extra holes, I missed three really good birdie looks back-to-back-to-back.”\r\n\r\nFor her second straight match, Kuehn rallied to advance to the North & South final.  On Friday, she trailed Rachel Heck in her quarterfinal by two with four holes to play before squaring the match on the 18th and winning on the 20th hole.  On Saturday morning, Kuehn fell behind by two through five holes to Michigan State’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/25643/Haylin-Harris?p=1\">Haylin Harris</a> before the Wake Forest sophomore won three of the next five.\r\n\r\nKuehn birdied the par-5 eighth and par-3 ninth to take the lead, then won the 12th and 14th to build a three-hole lead with three to play.  Harris conceded after Kuehn knocked her approach on the par-four 16th tight.",

    "teaser": "SMU’s McClure ‘Mac’ Meissner fires the low round of the tournament, then edges David Perkins in a playoff as the favorites fade",
    "articleText": "The attack of the Mac bested one of the most elite amateur fields of the summer.\r\n\r\nSMU’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22047/McClure-Meissner?p=1\">McClure ‘Mac’ Meissner</a> began the final round of the 114th Southern Amateur seven shots behind 54-hole leader <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/15400/Cole-Hammer?p=1\">Cole Hammer</a> (Texas). \r\n\r\nMeissner’s game plan for the final round was to just stay steady and let the course come to him. \r\n\r\n“My mindset was to make as many birdies as I could,” Meissner told AmateurGolf.com after turning in his scorecard to take the clubhouse lead, “and take advantage of the holes that they give you chances on.”\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SL4WY0Y1LO0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n\r\nHe didn’t even think he would be in a position to win. Looking to go a couple under par, Meissner surprised himself when he made the turn. Posting a front-side 4-under 32, Meissner thought to himself “I’ve got a chance here”.\r\n\r\nWith his dad Kurt on his bag, the duo saved their best work for last.\r\n\r\nMaking his lone bogey of the day on No. 10, Meissner rallied with three straight birdies on holes 12-14 before parring out to tie the low-round of the tournament with a 66.\r\n\r\n“It was all working pretty well,” Meissner said when asked what the best part of his game was on Saturday.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAs Hammer and fellow Longhorn <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22195/Pierceson-Coody?p=1\">Pierceson Coody</a> struggled to continue their pace, the third wheel of the final group rose to the occasion.\r\n\r\nIllinois State senior <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/23427/David-Perkins?p=1\">David Perkins</a> felt like it was him against the world as he was paired with Hammer and Coody. Coody, a member at Maridoe, had as big of a gallery as COVID-19 protocols would allow.\r\n\r\n“I definitely had some nerves to start,” Perkins said. “Mostly it was knowing that nobody really wanted me to win.”\r\n\r\nHalf joking, Perkins stayed within himself during a round that he says was not his best performance. Pushing his own bag, Perkins three-putted twice on the front nine en route to an even-par 36. With not much going positively or negatively, he finally got the spark he was looking for on the par-5 16th.\r\n\r\nMaking an eagle, Perkins piqued the interest of everyone with two holes remaining.\r\n\r\nHitting two “perfect” shots to leave as easy a chip as one could have on the glass-like greens at Maridoe, Perkins’ ball found the bottom of the cup before he needed his putter.\r\n\r\nComing away with par on 17, Perkins had a similar situation on the closing hole. Coming up short on his approach, Perkins had about 15-yards to the flag. He nearly holed out for the win. Tapping in for par and a final round 70, he headed back to the 18th tee to face Meissner as the pair tied at 7-under.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nBoth hit the fairway, but Perkins went first on the approach. Leaving it short and right just as he had done in regulation, the pressure was on Meissner to hit the green.\r\n\r\nDoing so from about 155 yards, Meissner left himself a 20-foot birdie putt and a near-lock par. Perkins two-putted following his chip, leaving the stage for Meissner to claim victory. Drilling an ever so stressful three-footer, Meissner was named the 2020 Southern Amateur champ.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had a lot of good finishes in my junior and college career,” Meissner said following the playoff, “but I haven’t really gotten it done much… It gives me a ton of confidence knowing that I’m good enough to be out here.

    "teaser": "As the coronavirus alters the amateur golf landscape, will the state amateur championship be an unexpected beneficiary?",
    "articleText": "The coronavirus pandemic has rearranged the 2020 competitive golf schedule. Professional majors have been rescheduled or cancelled, the college season was cut short, and the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/TheMajorsOfAmateurGolf\">Majors of Amateur Golf</a> calendar thinned out.\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26004/List-of-amateur-tournaments-affected-by-the-coronavirus-outbreak\">List of amateur tournaments affected by the coronavirus outbreak</a>\r\n\r\nIn our <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26055/The-return-of-the-state-am-\">original article</a>, we took a look at how state amateur championships, once considered among the most important tournaments to win, have struggled to draw top amateurs to their fields, as such players increasingly favor traveling out of state to play against each other. Some of the numbers were striking.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAs the year progresses, we are keeping an eye on state amateur championships around the country, looking to see if they might be the unexpected beneficiaries of the coronavirus pandemic, if players indeed travel less and stay closer to home.\r\n\r\n<b>August 2 update</b>\r\n\r\nThis was the biggest week of the summer for state amateurs, with 10 states -- Iowa, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Arizona and California -- conducting their state championships (New York was also scheduled but cancelled due to COVID-19).\r\n\r\nBut running opposite the Western Amateur meant that top-ranked players across the board skipped their state championships, even in the case of a defending champion like <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24757/William-Mouw?p=1\">William Mouw</a>, who skipped a title defense in California to compete in the Western (in fairness to California, they were originally scheduled to host the state am earlier in the summer but had to postpone due to COVID-19).\r\n\r\n<b>July 19 update</b>\r\n\r\nThis week there were a few players that chose the Southern Amateur over their state am, but overall the states continued to see improved fields in 2020.\r\n\r\nIn Ohio, six of the top eight ranked players were in the field as Austin Greaser moved to No. 1 with an eight-shot win at Columbus Country Club.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts, seven of the top ten players competed for the state amateur title.\r\n\r\n<b>July 12 update</b>\r\n\r\nIn Georgia, only two of the state's top ten players were in the field, with the highest-ranked player, Luke Schniederjans, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26186/Luke-Schniederjans-wins-99th-Georgia-Amateur\">taking the title</a>. Many of the other highly-ranked players chose to pay in the North & South and/or the Southern Amateur.\r\n\r\nMany of the smaller states continue to draw their best players as in normal years. In Maine, No. 1 ranked Cole Anderson successfully defended his title, while Garren Poirier (Vermont) and James Pleat (New Hampshire) rose to No. 1 with their wins.\r\n\r\n<b>June 28 update</b>\r\n\r\nSix state amateurs teed off this past week, and all six had great fields. In Mississippi, where a <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26150/Isaiah-Jackson-wins-The-Mississippi-Amateur\">PGA Tour start was on the line</a>, eight of the top ten players in the state were in the field. Oregon, Arkansas and Missouri all had seven top-10 players playing, while Missouri had six. And four of the top five players from the state of Wyoming competed in their state championship.\r\n\r\n<b>June 21 update</b>\r\n\r\nThe North Carolina Amateur only drew one player in the state's top 10 (#4 Jonathan Brightwell who lost in a playoff to Peter Fountain), and 6 in the top 20. Many of the state's top-raked players, including #1 Ryan Gerard of Raleigh, will be in the field at next week's North & South Amateur in Pinehurst.\r\n\r\n<b>June 14 update</b>\r\n\r\nThe Louisiana State Amateur was the first men's state am to tee off post-lockdown, with <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26119/Louisiana-Amateur--John-Humphries-wins-his-second-straight-\">John Humphries winning his second-straight title</a>. An impressive five of the top seven ranked players in the state of Louisiana were in the field, including the eventual champion, but the top two -- LSU Tiger teammates Philip Barbaree and Trey Winstead -- skipped the event.\r\n\r\nIn Indiana, two USGA champions battled for the women's state championship, with Erica Shepherd pulling away from Julia Potter-Bobb <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26117/Shepherd-wins-battle-of-USGA-champs-at-Indiana-Women-s-Am\">to win her first Indiana state title</a>.\r\n\r\nAlso, Paul Pope of the Ohio Golf Association reports that they have received a record number of qualifier and exempt player entries into the Ohio Amateur, which will be held in mid-July.",

    "teaser": "The Spanish flu epidemic and two world wars didn't stop the oldest continuous tournament in the world, held every year since 1899",
    "articleText": "During the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, we wrote about the Utah Golf Association and it's determined executive director Jake Miller.\r\n\r\nAt the time, Miller said he would hold the tournament in December if required to keep the 121-year streak going. After all, it's the oldest continually-held tournament in the world. As it turns out, the storied golf association didn't have to hold out for winter and the tournament starts today. We will be following it all week. \r\n\r\nHere's a repost of our coverage of the Utah Golf Association's decision process:\r\n\r\nThe Utah State Amateur Championship was first played in 1899 and has been played every year since, earning the title of the oldest continuous tournament in the world.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish flu epidemic of 1918-19 couldn't interrupt the the championship; neither could World War I or World War II. But could the tournament, and the 121-year streak, be in jeopardy due to the coronavirus pandemic?\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nNot if Jake Miller, the executive director of the Utah Golf Association (UGA), has his way.\r\n\r\n\"I refuse to go down as the executive director that allowed us to lose the moniker of the longest continuously held tournament in the world,\" said Miller to <a href=\"https://www.abc4.com/sports/utah-state-amateur-121-year-streak-in-jeopardy/\" target=\"_blank\">Dana Greene of ABC4 Sports in Murray, Utah</a>. \"So if it's the week after Christmas in St. George where we’re running this thing, we’ll do it.\"\r\n\r\nThe 122nd Utah State Amateur is scheduled for June 22-27, and although the UGA has suspended all activities through the end of April, the championship and its various qualifiers are, for now, still on as scheduled.\r\n\r\nBut one of the big lessons of the current pandemic is that the best laid plans can suddenly be tossed up in the air.\r\n\r\nBut Miller, bearing the weight of history and the determination to maintain the streak, is confident that Utah will find a way to conduct the championship in 2020.\r\n\r\nFrom <a href=\"https://www.abc4.com/sports/utah-state-amateur-121-year-streak-in-jeopardy/\" target=\"_blank\">Greene's report (which includes a video interview with Miller)</a>:\r\n\r\n\"If you look around the state, the professionals around the state, so many of them played in this event when they were in college or high school and it holds a special place in a lot of golf professional’s hearts,\" Miller said. \"So we expect that if worst comes to worst and we don’t have some of the opportunities that are set up currently, that there will be plenty of PGA pros and facilities around the state that would be willing to step up and make sure that the Utah State Amateur happens this year. The State Am may not look like it normally looks like in 2020 but we will be playing golf and somebody will hoist the trophy.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the championship is played, reigning U.S. Junior champion Preston Summerhays will be gunning for his third straight state championship.",
