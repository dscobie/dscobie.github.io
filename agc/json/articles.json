    "articleText": "If you follow any professional golfers on social media, more than likely you’ve seen them performing golf-specific workouts with expensive equipment in expansive personal gyms. Squat racks, heavy ropes, medicine balls and barbells will cost you hundreds of dollars and require a ton of extra square footage. If you are anything like me, your “gym” is really just a corner in a spare room. For the average amateur golfer, fitness and training equipment needs to be compact, easy-to-access and <i>cheap!</i>\r\n<br><br>\r\nThese are our top picks for golf training and fitness equipment for under $40.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<strong>FOAM ROLLER</strong>\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2YlWpQ6\"><img src=\"https://amateurgolf.com/images/TopGolfFitnessProducts_Foamroller.png\"></a></div>\r\n\r\nThe benefits of a foam roller for a golfer are numerous, but the most important benefit is myofascial release. Myofascial release is the application of low-intesity force to the soft tissues in your body. Using a foam roller to massage strained ligaments and muscular tissue can greatly reduce healing time and reduce inflammation in your joints. The benefits for a golfer also includes increased blood flow to muscles and a better range of motion.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2YlWpQ6\"><img src=\"https://amateurgolf.com/images/BUYNOW.png\"></a></div>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<strong>RESISTANCE BANDS</strong>\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2JBpYdc\"><img src=\"https://amateurgolf.com/images/TopGolfFitnessProducts_ResistanceBands.png\"></a></div>\r\n\r\n\r\nResistance band training increases tension in your muscles, causing them to contract and build stability.  Lower body training with resistance bands is an important and <i>cheap</i> addition to a home golf gym. \r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2JBpYdc\"><img src=\"https://amateurgolf.com/images/BUYNOW.png\"></a></div>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<strong>KETTLEBELL</strong>\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2WqKU8t\"><img src=\"https://amateurgolf.com/images/TopGolfFitnessProducts_KettleBells.png\"></a></div>\r\n\r\nVisit any TPI or sport specific training facility and you will see a collection of Kettlebells. For golfers, core power, balance, flexibility and coordination are key. Kettlebell workouts hit all of these key areas by targeting the core, hamstrings, glutes and shoulders while being low impact.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2WqKU8t\"><img src=\"https://amateurgolf.com/images/BUYNOW.png\"></a></div>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<strong>PULL-UP BAR</strong>\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Yr3orl\"><img src=\"https://amateurgolf.com/images/TopGolfFitnessProducts_Pullupbar.png\"></a></div>\r\n\r\n\r\nStrong shoulders and a healthy back are vital to a good golf swing. Pull-ups not only help to strengthen both your back and shoulders, they also help elongate those muscles. These compact doorway pull-up bars are a convenient way to get your daily reps.  These bars can also be used for push-ups and dips. \r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Yr3orl\"><img src=\"https://amateurgolf.com/images/BUYNOW.png\"></a></div>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<strong>MEDICINE BALL</strong>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2urlrzx\"><img src=\"https://amateurgolf.com/images/TopGolfFitnessProducts_MedicineBall.png\"></a></div>\r\n\r\n\r\nAs long as you don’t have any downstairs neighbors, medicine ball slams (pick up medicine ball over head and slam down with both hands) are one of the most beneficial exercises for golfers.  Movements with medicine balls are considered explosive, and can help train golfers to transfer energy with their core.  This can directly translate to longer and straighter golf shots.\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2urlrzx\"><img src=\"https://amateurgolf.com/images/BUYNOW.png\"></a></div>\r\n",

    "articleText": "<span style=\"font-size:20px; font-weight:bold\">THE CRUMP CUP</span><br>\r\n<b>Pine Valley Golf Club, Pine Valley, New Jersey</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe George A. Crump Memorial Tournament-- named for the hotelier and course architect most famous for building Pine Valley -- <a href=\"http://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/20179/Is-the-Crump-Cup-the-Best-Tournament-in-Amateur-Golf-\">might just be the best tournament in amateur golf</a>.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe best mid-amateurs and seniors play 36 holes of stroke play qualifying, followed by four rounds of match play. Players are flighted according to their qualifying position, and it is not uncommon to see Walker Cuppers and USGA champions in the fourth flight.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nPine Valley has topped course ranking lists for years, and those lucky enough to play there understand why. From ideal playing surfaces, to an amazing set of greens, to some of the most severe hazards in golf, this course has it all. Most will never know by playing, but anyone can tour the grounds on Crump Cup Sunday, the only day of the year the gates open to everyone.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/269/The-Crump-Cup\">More information about the Crump Cup</a><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00051665.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px; font-weight:bold\">THE ST. ANDREWS LINKS TROPHY</span><br>\r\n<b>The Old Course, St. Andrews, Scotland</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nMost travel to the home of golf as tourists, but the course that tourists play will never play like it does in the St. Andrews Links Trophy, which brings together the best amateur golfers from across Europe and around the world.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe field plays one round on the Old Course and one round on another St. Andrews Course (usually the New, sometimes the Jubilee), before the field is cut to the low 40 and ties. Two rounds are then played on the Old Course on the final day.<br><br>\r\n\r\nEvery round on the Old Course in the Links Trophy begins and ends in a thrill -- first, teeing it up in front of the R&A clubhouse where so many greats of the game have, and then walking across the Swilken Bridge and up through the Valley of Sin onto the final green with seemingly the entire town looking on.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/3351/St--Andrews-Links-Trophy\">More information about the St. Andrews Links Trophy</a><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00051666.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px; font-weight:bold\">THE AUGUSTA NATIONAL WOMEN'S AMATEUR</span><br>\r\n<b>Augusta National Golf Club, Augusta, Georgia</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nAugusta National has long been a dream destination for amateur golfers, but until now the only way to get there has been to win a major world amateur competition and receive an invitation into the Masters. Now the club founded by the greatest amateur ever (Bobby Jones) is opening its doors to 72 of the best women amateurs in the world for the Augusta National Women's Amateur, played the week before the Masters.<br><br>\r\n\r\nDespite carrying the name of the tournament, only one round of three is played at Augusta National. The first two rounds are played at nearby Champions Retreat, with the low 30 scorers advancing to the hallowed grounds for the final round. In another rarity, there is a practice round played in the middle of the tournament, so that the entire field gets their chance to see and play Augusta National.<br><br>\r\n\r\nLong-time Masters viewers are familiar with just about every shot on the course, but the arrival of the women's game is sure to <a href=\"http://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/23590/The-women-will-bring-out-the-genius-of-Augusta-National\">bring out a side of Augusta National none of us has ever seen</a>.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/8532/Augusta-National-Women-s-Amateur-Championship\">More information about the Augusta National Women's Amateur</a><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00051667.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px; font-weight:bold\">THE C.B. MACDONALD INVITATIONAL</span><br>\r\n<b>National Golf Links of America, Southampton, New York</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nThis tournament honors Charles Blair MacDonald, who is considered to be the father of modern golf course architecture. He was the first U.S. Amateur champion, and his 1909 design of the National Golf Links of America was revolutionary. Many of the holes at NGLA are MacDonald's versions of famous holes from British courses, while others are entirely original and have served as templates themselves for future designers. Hard-running fairways, blind shots, and and emphasis of strategy over power make NGLA a true throwback.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nLike Pine Valley, NGLA is a place that most will never see, although the Walker Cup was played there in 2013. But those invited to the C.B. MacDonald Invitational, also known more simply as The Singles, get to experience match play competition on one of the world's most unique and inspiring courses.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAn 18-hole stroke play qualifying round is played to determine match play brackets (five for mid-amateurs, three for seniors), with four rounds of match play following to determine the champion.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/7578/The-C-B--MacDonald-Annual-Invitational-Tournament\">More information about the C.B.

It has emerged as the top tournament in Australia, and draws a strong international field.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFor its first 20 years, the Master of the Amateurs had a male-only field, but in 2018 a separate women's competition (and jacket) was introduced, and it too has become one of the world's top amateur events for women. All competitors in each competition play 72 holes of stroke play.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe West Course at Royal Melbourne is the highest-ranked course in the Southern Hemisphere, and the East Course is highly rated as well. Firm-running turf, boldly-sloped greens and immaculately-carved steep-and-deep bunkers make Royal Melbourne the model that all of the other Melbourne Sandbelt courses have tried to follow.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBoth courses are a product of famed course architect Alister Mackenzie's trip to Australia in the 1920's, which advanced the understanding of course design in an area ideally suited for golf. Mackenzie is best known for designing Augusta National in Georgia and Cypress Point in California.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/5500/Australian-Master-of-the-Amateurs\">More information about the Master of the Amateurs</a><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><a href=\"http://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/Search\"><img src=\"http://www.amateurgolf.com/images/TournamentFinderTitleistBanner.png\"></a></div><br>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px; font-weight:bold\">MORE TOURNAMENTS FOR YOU</span><br><br>\r\n\r\nThese are just a few of the over 3000 golf tournaments that can be found through our <a href=\"http://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/Search\">Tournament Finder</a> presented by Titleist.

    "teaser": "Tiger Woods tying Sam Snead's all-time wins record made us revisit: Which amateur records are still in play? Not these 5.",
    "articleText": "<i>With golf on hold (for now), Tiger Woods sits tied with Sam Snead for the all-time record of 82 PGA Tour wins. After watching the replay of Tiger's win at last year's Masters, we thought it was a good time to revisit an article we wrote shortly after his win.</i><br><br>\r\n\r\nWith Tiger Woods’ Masters victory completing a remarkable and unlikely comeback, his pursuit of the most famous record in all of golf, the 18 major titles won by Jack Nicklaus, is back on. Which got us to thinking: what are the most impressive records of amateur golf, which ones are still in play, and which ones will never be broken? Let’s start with the ones that are untouchable:<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>TIGER WOODS: WINNING 3 U.S. AMATEURS IN A ROW</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nBefore Tiger Woods, there had been 10 instances of a successful U.S. Amateur title defense (most recently Jay Sigel in 1982-83), and two golfers had done it twice: Bobby Jones and Jerome Travers. All of those previous attempts at a three-peat fell short, but Woods completed the feat in 1994-96, defeating two future USGA champions (Trip Kuehne, Buddy Marucci) in the three finals. Combined with his three straight U.S. Junior wins in 1991-93, it meant six straight years with a USGA championship. No one has repeated at the U.S. Amateur since, and given the depth of the amateur game today, we’re betting that Woods’ record of three straight U.S. Ams is safe.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>BOBBY JONES: WINNING 5 U.S. AMATEURS</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\">\r\n                <div style=\"float:left; padding-right: 15px;\">\r\n                <img src=\"/images/uploads/00052961.jpg\" alt=\"Bobby Jones (USGA photo)\">\r\n                <span id=\"ContentPlaceHolder1_labArticleImageCaption\" class=\"caption\"><br/>Bobby Jones, at left (USGA photo)<br/><br/></span>\r\n                </div>\r\n</div>\r\nGone are the days when an amateur could be the best player in the world (although Tiger Woods was as close as it gets, given his 12-shot Masters win less than a year after turning pro), and certainly gone are the days when the best player in the world would choose to remain a career amateur. When Bobby Jones won five U.S. Amateurs from 1924-30, the latter en route to winning the Grand Slam, the tournament was one of the four biggest in golf, a true major. Today it is the biggest major of amateur golf, but the depth of fields and the pull to capitalize on a U.S. Amateur win by turning pro mean that this record might be the safest in amateur golf.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>CAROL SEMPLE THOMPSON: WINNING 22 STATE AMATEURS</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\">\r\n                <div style=\"float:left; padding-right: 15px;\">\r\n                <img src=\"/images/uploads/00052962.jpg\" alt=\"Carol Semple Thompson (USGA photo)\">\r\n                <span id=\"ContentPlaceHolder1_labArticleImageCaption\" class=\"caption\"><br/>Carol Semple Thompson (USGA photo)<br/><br/></span>\r\n                </div>\r\n</div>\r\nFor most amateur golfers, a victory in their state amateur would be the crowning achievement of their golf career. In the state of Pennsylvania, Carol Semple Thompson was crowned 22 times. Semple (who became known Semple Thompson once married) first won the Pennsylvania Women’s Amateur in 1969 as a 20-year-old. Over the course of her career she would have winning streaks of six, five, four and three in the event. Her final win came as a 57-year-old, 37 years after her first. She was a seven-time USGA champion, and while that feat has since been matched, her record of 22 state amateur wins will not be.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>JOE CARR: 11 WALKER CUP TEAMS / CAROL SEMPLE THOMPSON: 12 CURTIS CUP TEAMS</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\">\r\n                <div style=\"float:left; padding-right: 15px;\">\r\n                <img src=\"/images/uploads/00052963.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Carr and Carol Semple Thompson\">\r\n                <span id=\"ContentPlaceHolder1_labArticleImageCaption\" class=\"caption\"><br/>Joe Carr and Carol Semple Thompson<br/><br/></span>\r\n                </div>\r\n</div>\r\nJoe Carr was one of Ireland’s great amateur golfers, winning three British Amateurs, becoming the first Irishman to play in the Masters, and becoming the first non-American to earn the Bob Jones Award. He represented Great Britain & Ireland on a record 11 Walker Cup teams from 1947 to 1967. Carol Semple Thompson, in addition to her 22 state amateur titles and seven USGA championships mentioned above, is one of only eleven players to have won both the U.S. and British Women’s Amateurs, and she too would go on to earn the Bob Jones Award. Semple Thompson made a record 12 Curtis Cup teams, and clinched the U.S. team’s win in 2002 (at the age of 53) with a 27-foot birdie putt on the final hole. Both Carr and Semple Thompson are World Golf Hall of Famers, and both will likely hold their records in perpetuity.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>CHARLIE COE: ALMOST EVERY MASTERS RECORD THERE IS</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\">\r\n                <div style=\"float:left; padding-right: 15px;\">\r\n                <img src=\"/images/uploads/00052964.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie Coe (AP photo)\">\r\n                <span id=\"ContentPlaceHolder1_labArticleImageCaption\" class=\"caption\"><br/>Charlie Coe (AP photo)<br/><br/></span>\r\n                </div>\r\n</div>\r\nCharlie Coe played in what was probably the last era of the truly great career amateur, right around the time that the popularity of the professional game was exploding with the arrival of Arnold Palmer and televised golf. Coe, twice a U.S. Amateur champion, made 19 Masters appearances, and still owns practically every significant Masters amateur record, including most rounds played (67), best finish (runner-up to Gary Player in 1961), lowest 72-hole score (281), most top-10 finishes (3), most top-25 finishes (9), most cuts made (15), most times low amateur (6), and lowest third-round score (67). Of these records, the low total of 281 and the low third-round score of 67 are most likely to be broken, but the others won’t be.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n<b>OTHER ACHIEVEMENTS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE MATCHED AGAIN</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nSome of amateur golf’s greatest accomplishments might be in play to be repeated, although some have stood for decades. Here they are, along with the year last achieved:<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>2016 – The last time a player won two USGA individual championships in the same year.</b><br><table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/rankings/15187.JPG\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><div style=\"text-align:center; font-size:14px;\">Eun-jeong Seong</div>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\nChick Evans and Bobby Jones each won the U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur, Ryan Moore and Colt Knost won the U.S. Amateur and U.S. Public Links, Pearl Sinn and Jennifer Song won the U.S. Women’s Amateur and U.S. Women’s Public Links, and Jay Sigel won the U.S. Amateur and U.S. Mid-Amateur. Eun-jeong Seong <a href=\"http://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/17294/Eun-Jeong-Seong-makes-history-with-U-S--Women-s-Amateur-victory\">was the latest to do it</a>, winning the U.S. Girls Junior and U.S. Women’s Amateur.

Mid-amateurs have had their chances along the way -- three mid-ams were among the 8 quarterfinalists at Oakmont in 2003 and Austin Eaton III made the semifinals two years later -- but since 2006, only Nathan Smith in 2014 has made it as far as the quarterfinals.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>1991 – The last time an amateur won a PGA Tour event.</b><br>\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00052966.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><div style=\"text-align:center; font-size:14px;\">Phil Mickelson</div>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\nIt has happened eight times, first by Frank Stranahan in 1945 (he would repeat the feat in 1948) and most recently by Phil Mickelson at the 1991 Northern Telecom Open while he was a student at Arizona State University. Fred Haas, Cary Middlecoff, Gene Littler, Doug Sanders and Scott Verplank were the others. (On the LPGA Tour, Lydia Ko won <a href=\"http://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/8531/Ko-wins-Canadian-Women-s-Open\">back-to-back</a> Canadian Opens in 2012-13, the latest of five women amateurs to do it.)<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>1967 – The last time a player won the U.S. and British Amateurs in the same year.</b><br>\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00052967.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><div style=\"text-align:center; font-size:14px;\">Bob Dickson</div>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\nHarold Hilton was the first to do it in 1911, Bobby Jones followed in 1930 during the year of his Grand Slam, and Lawson Little did it two years in a row in 1934 and 1935. Bob Dickson was the last to win both in the same year in 1967, and since then only three players have won both tournaments in the same <i>career</i>. If it’s going to happen again, it’ll either have to be done by an international player, or Americans will have to start playing in the British Amateur as much as they used to.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>1933 – The last time an amateur won a men’s professional major.</b><br>\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00052968.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><div style=\"text-align:center; font-size:14px;\">Johnny Goodman</div>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\nJohnny Goodman won the U.S. Open as an amateur at North Shore in Illinois, and while several amateurs since then have had runner-up finishes (though none since 1961), none have repeated the feat. In 2015, Paul Dunne of Ireland became the first amateur to <a href=\"http://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/15014/Amateur-Paul-Dunne-has-share-of-lead-at-The-Open-Championship\">take the 54-hole lead</a> in the British Open in 88 years, and his third-round 66 was the lowest shot by an amateur at St. Andrews in its 142-year-old history of hosting the championship. He would fade in the final round, but not before threatening to duplicate a feat that many felt unrepeatable.

Especially as the winds made the greens rock hard and fast, with pin positions in hard locations.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nComing off a tournament low 64, Jack Thompson made three bogeys and shot 39 on the front.

His back nine was exactly the same - seven-straight bogeys followed by a flourishing birdie-eagle finish on Nos. 17 and 18.

Along with the Mevo, you get a quick start guide, a charging cable, a carrying pouch, and metallic stickers. It has a rechargeable internal battery that can be fully charged in around two hours and lasts for about four hours when fully charged.\r\n\r\nSetup is very easy with the Mevo.  After it was fully charged, I downloaded the Mevo Mobile App on IOS and created an account. Once I was signed in, I hit ‘Start’ and it took less than 10 seconds for the Mevo to connect with my phone.  The Mevo should be set 4-7 feet behind the golf ball, level with the playing surface and pointed down the target line.  I tested the Mevo on the driving range, and I was able to place it on the very back of the mat.  One thing to note is that, like many of the launch monitors at this price level, you also have to select the club you are hitting to get accurate readings.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://amateurgolf.com/images/equipment/FlightScope_Mevo3.png\"></div>\r\n\r\nThe Mevo interface on the app is, hands down, one of the best and easiest to use in the category.  I really loved being able to customize the different shot displays. Although the Mevo is small and unassuming, seeing carry, swing speed, ball speed, and spin immediately after impact in big and bold numbers on my phone feels like a premium launch monitor experience.  In all fairness, the performance gap between a $10,000 Flightscope X3 and the $500 Mevo is probably significant, but the data you can gather with Mevo will tell you the same story for much less money.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to this price point for a launch monitor, the first thing that anyone one asks is how accurate it is.  I found that that the accuracy of the readings were nearly spot on when I made good contact with a mid-iron.  I tested the Mevo on a relatively flat fairway with a 7 iron and recorded 5 shots with the Mevo.  I then had a spotter mark the golf ball and we used a range finder to compare the distances. All things considered, the Mevo averaged less than 3 yards off on the carry distance on my 7 iron.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://amateurgolf.com/images/equipment/FlightScope_Mevo4.png\"></div>\r\n\r\nAlthough the Mevo can help all golfers in some way, it was really designed for a golfer looking to improve how they practice.  Don’t get me wrong, it is great for just seeing how far you bombed your new driver or measuring swing speed changes, but if you really want to benefit from Mevo, you will have to build it into your practice.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about Mevo visit <a href=\"https://mevo.golf/3bFxHAf\">Flightscope's website<a/>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://mevo.golf/3bFxHAf\">USE CODE: AGC TO SAVE $50 ON FLIGHTSCOPE MEVO</a>",

    "title": "Callaway MAVRIK and MAVRIK Sub Zero Driver review",
    "teaser": "Callaway has pushed the limits of artificial intelligence to find a driver design that could not have been conceived by any human.",
    "articleText": "For 2020 Callaway Golf pushed the limits of A.I. Technology to produce a driver that literally could not have been designed by any human. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIt's called the Mavrik, and it's available in three models. For this review, we will compare the Mavrik and Mavrik Sub Zero models, both of which we were able to take to the range and the golf course to put through their paces prior to the official pre-order date, January 14.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t6qkGLlOBzI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n\r\nLast year’s Epic Flash drivers utilized an A.I.-designed “Flash Face” that quickly became a top played driver on the WorldWide Tours, and became the top-selling driver at retail as well. The Callaway Research & Design team Used AI Technolgy to rapidly create and test 15,000 different designs until they landed on the perfect face design. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBut knowing they were only good as their last hit product, the design engineers at Callaway asked for more computing power, and they got in in the form of a new supercomputer. Armed with what they learned designing Epic Flash, these same engineers wondered would happen if they could unleash the massive technology onto other aspects of club design, even thinking about how the ball sounded coming off the face?<br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059567.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\nFor starters, think about the face of the driver. It's where the ball makes contact, and it's the part of the \"machine learning\" of Artificial Intelligence where Callaway learned the most with Epic Flash last year. This go around, they set out to push the boundaries so far that a new material was required to support the ultra-thin face design the supercomputer came up with. The material, FS2S titanium, is not only stronger, it's 6g lighter than the material in Epic Flash. And rather than just design one face for each driver, the supercomputer came up with a specific design for each model.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhat that means is that once you determine the driver type that's right for your swing, you can be assured the face is delivering the most \"pop\" for that head design. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059568.jpg\" alt=\"Callaway MAVRIK Driver Testing\"></div>\r\n\r\nTUNING SOUND<br><br>\r\n\r\nOn the range, you'll not only appreciate the way the Mavrik drivers feel and the ball flight they deliver. You'll definitely notice the sound, which doesn't have as much of a tinny resonance as the Epic Flash models. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBased on player feedback, Callaway \"asked\" the supercomputer to deliver a significant improvement on the acoustics without requiring a shape redesign or major change in weight or materials. Allowed by the programmers to move just a few grams of weight internally, the supercomputer came up with a precise shape and placement of this weight. And the sound is noticeable -- if you love the sound of a drive being struck perfectly, you're going to love Mavrik.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSo now that you know a little more about what Callaway has been keeping under wraps for the past year, let's take a look at the two models that most lower handicap players are likely going to choose between.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>MAVRIK DRIVERS</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\">\r\n                <div style=\"float:left; padding-right: 15px;\">\r\n                <img src=\"/images/uploads/00059570.jpg\" alt=\"- AmateurGolf.com photo\">\r\n                </div>\r\n</div>\r\nOur testers love the shape of the \"standard\" MAVRIK driver. The crown is flatter, and shallower from front to back. It just looks sleek. Flip it over, and you'll notice that the sole sweeps up sharply in the rear. Callaway calls this overall shape \"Cyclone Aero\" and claims it reduces drag. We just go by the look, feel, distance and sound off the face compared to Epic Flash, and our early tests put check marks across the board. And we're guessing that a lot of low handicap golfers are going to fit into this model, even some that used a one of the Sub-Zero drivers in the past. You've got to see and hit both for yourself to decide. After hitting my first three drives with MAVRIK, I joked \"I can't think of a single reason why you wouldn't like this driver.\"<br><br> \r\n\r\nAs for features found in previous models of Callaway drivers, the company continues to improve features like \"Jailbreak\" -- positioning the two internal bars that connect the sole and crown to deliver maximum ball speed across the face.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of the crown, a lighter carbon crown in MAVRIK allows for even higher MOI. As well, the head’s internal and external weighting includes a single, fixed 5g weight positioned at the sole’s back-center, to promote mid-level spin and a moderate draw bias. <br><br>\r\n\r\nMORE INFORMATION<br><br>\r\n\r\nCallaway's MAVRIK Driver is available in 9, 10.5, and 12 degree lofts<br>Preorder Date: Jan. 14, 2020<br>At Retail Date: Jan. 23, 2020<br>Price: $499<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>MAVRIK SUB-ZERO DRIVERS</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\">\r\n                <div style=\"float:left; padding-right: 15px;\">\r\n                <img src=\"/images/uploads/00059571.jpg\" alt=\"- AmateurGolf.com photo\">\r\n                </div>\r\n</div>\r\nLike all of Callaway’s Sub Zero models from the past five years, MAVRIK Sub Zero offers a rare combination of low spin and high MOI. And also like previous models, it's clearly going to be the choice of high clubhead speed players. But if you're in the 100mph range, there are other variables that might make Sub Zero fit your swing -- we encourage you to hit both and try and number of shaft options to make sure you're maximizing your distance when ordering a MAVRIK driver.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd since look at address has such an important part in the feedback loop that results in your confidence, if you like the shape of the head there is likely a loft and shaft combination to make Sub Zero a potential fit.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe slightly smaller (450cc) head features two interchangeable screws in the front and back, 14g and 2g, to promote changes to launch angle and spin-rate. MAVRIK Sub Zero has a neutral ball flight bias and the lie angle is slightly flatter compared to the Standard and MAX models. <br><br>\r\n\r\nMORE INFORMATION<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe MAVRIK Sub Zero is available in 9 and 10.5 degree lofts.<br>Preorder Date: Jan. 14, 2020<br>At Retail Date: Jan. 23, 2020<br>Price: $499<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059572.jpg\" alt=\"Callaway MAVRIK Driver Testing\"></div>\r\n",

    "teaser": "The 18-year-old amateur is at 10-under-par 132, trailing Finland’s Tapio Pulkkanen by a single shot with a chance to make history",
    "articleText": "JOHANNESBURG: History beckons at Randpark Golf Club this weekend for the final two rounds of the R17,5-million South African Open, hosted by the City of Joburg, at Randpark Golf Club.\r\n\r\nActually – in terms of the way golf has developed over the decades – one could say that \"ancient history\" is beckoning.\r\n\r\nIt has been 61 long years since an amateur won the world’s second oldest title, and that honour belonged to Denis Hutchinson way back in 1959.\r\n\r\nPerhaps amateurs aren’t meant to win professional tournaments these days, let alone national opens competing against the some of the world’s best professionals. It just doesn’t happen.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nBut GolfRSA whiz kid Jayden Schaper is tantalizingly close.\r\n\r\nThe 18-year-old Ebotse amateur is on 10-under-par 132 in this year’s championship following a superb 65 on the par-71 Bushwillow course on Thursday and an equally fine 67 on Friday on the Firethorn, also a par-71.\r\n\r\nFinland’s Tapio Pulkkanen tops a jam-packed leaderboard on 11-under 131 following a 66 on Firethorn and he leads by one shot from five players.\r\n\r\n“I’m really happy to be on top of the leaderboard but, after birdies at three of the first six holes, I really had to grind out the pars,” Pukkanen said. “Today was much tougher than the opening round, because we had a lot of wind out there. I’ve just come off 10 weeks of practice in America and it was such a good move to do that as I really think I found my game.”\r\n\r\nFor Schaper to be in the chasing pack alongside England’s Sam Horsfield (68) and fellow South Africans Jaco Ahlers (66), Trevor Fisher Junior (67) and Thriston Lawrence (65), is a massive story in golfing terms.\r\n\r\nWhen asked if he will be nervous going into the final two rounds, Schaper replied: “The way I see it, it’s the same golf course. It’s the same 14 clubs. I’ll treat it as any amateur event I’ve played in. There will be a bit of nerves, but I kind of enjoy that. I’m just looking forward to the weekend.\r\n\r\nYes, the field is a stronger one than I’m used to, but I’m not worried about the other players, I’m just out to play my own game.\r\n\r\nSchaper turned one-over after following a birdie on the sixth with successive drops, but he fought his way past playing partner and defending champion Louis Oosthuizen with five birdies down the inward loop.\r\n\r\n”I trusted my guts out there today and finished well,” said Schaper, who finished two shots better than the 2020 Open champion.\r\n\r\n“It would be pretty special to match what Mr Hutchinson did. I’m just going to take it one shot at a time. If the opportunity comes, I’ll try my best to take it,” added reigning SA Stroke Play champion, who won the Junior Players Championship in America, considered the most prestigious junior tournament in the world.\r\n\r\nOosthuizen described Schaper’s golf over the first two days as “brilliant” while saying his own game Friday was very frustrating. “I hit the ball from tee to green as well as I can but the putts just wouldn’t drop,” said the tournament host.\r\n\r\nOosthuizen is on eight-under 134 and one of no less than 22 players within three shots of the Finn.\r\n\r\nPulkkanen’s lead so it’s definitely game on for Saturday and Sunday and the final 36 holes.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nSchaper looks a shoe-in to collect the Freddie Tait Cup as the leading amateur, but don’t write off his GolfRSA National Squad team-mates who also made the 36-hole cut.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa’s leading junior Casey Jarvis and former SA Amateur champion Christo Lamprecht both finished on four-under-par 138, and both showed glimpses of great form on the second day. Lamprecht got it to seven-under through 14 holes on Firethorn before he gave three shots back, while Jarvis fought back from four-over with an eagle and three birdies on the inward nine on Bushwillow to make the weekend.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Daniel Greene is well-placed on 9-under with American Johanness Veerman, who was the first round leader and England duo Harry Hall and Jack Senior.\r\n\r\nGreen put down his good golf here to getting back to basics after a heart-to-heart chat with his coach Rae Hast, the former South African amateur and professional champion, who is also his aunt.\r\n\r\n“My confidence has been a bit low so earlier this week I had a talk with her over the phone and she gave me some swing thoughts. So before my first round on Thursday I started to hit the ball well on the range, and I went on to shoot 67 on Firethorn,” said the 34-year-old. “Rae has been teaching me golf since I was a little guy, maybe seven years old, chipping in the garden in Nottingham Road, and I owe a lot to her.”\r\n\r\nWith his new-found confidence after a pep talk with his aunt, can Green win this weekend?\r\n\r\n“Look, we all want to win but there’s still a long way to go – a lot of golf to be played. There also the extra pressure of this being our national open but I’ll just put that out of mind and see what happens.”\r\n\r\nWith the quality trio of Oosthuizen, Branden Grace and George Coetzee lurking just three off the pace in a big group of players on eight under, the scene is set for what is certain to be a thrilling weekend of golf.\r\n\r\nSunday could just see “ancient history” being made if Schaper wins and one man who would be only too glad to see his record finally fall would be that now old campaigner-turned voice of golf Denis Hutchinson. And wouldn’t it be special if it happened on the day that “Hutchie” – as we all know him and love him – does his final golf broadcast at Randpark.",

This year the second round was cancelled due to rain, so Farnam never got the chance to give the Sunday chase to win his first AmateurGolf.com event.<br><br>\r\n\r\nToday, he birdied half the holes and recorded just a single bogey on his way to a 64 that missed the competitive course record of 63 (set by Max Homa and Michael Weaver while playing this same event some years back) by one.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut this tournament is anything but over. Also finishing towards the end of the draw today was Farnam's St. Mary's teammate Blake Hathcoat. Hathcoat posted a bogey-free 65. And get this -- Hathcoat had three 2s on the back nine -- making birdie on each of the side's three par 3s.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nBrendan Hy, a freshman at Cal, also flirted with a low number today -- at one point he was 7-under before recording a couple of bogeys coming home and posting 67. He will round out the final threesome. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAll tolled, there were 21 players under par today. Any of them is capable of throwing up a low number at the Jack Nicklaus Tournament Course tomorrow. It should make for an interesting round of golf. Spectators are welcome.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFun Fact: <br><br>\r\n\r\nThere are three past Silicon Valley Amateur players on the PGA Tour this year, and two on the Korn Ferry Tour. PGA Tour players Max Homa, Collin Morikawa (Cal Berkeley) and Maverick McNealy (Stanford) played this tournament while in college. The same goes for Korn-Ferry Tour players Brandon Hagy and Michael Kim. Homa won here in 2011; Morikawa did so in 2016.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMID-AM DIVISION<br><br>\r\n\r\nKyle Rector of San Diego shot a bogey-free 68 to lead the Mid-Am division by a single shot over former Stanford golfer Kyle Gentry of Menlo Park (69) Gentry, starting off on the back nine was going along ok though 7 holes at 1-over. Then he caught fire, with 5-straight birdies starting at the 17th hole and ending at No. 3. Both golfers look good to finish high in the overall standings, and either could win with a low round on Sunday.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSENIORS<br><br>\r\n\r\nDaniel O'Connor of San Francisco and Glen Andrade of Napa are tied at the top after solid rounds of 73 on the Valley Course. James Ponsford is three shots back at 76.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNET FLIGHT<br><br>\r\n\r\n10-handicapper Stotz Thoda posted a very solid round of 79 today; his net 69 leads the net flight  going into Sunday's final round.",

A lot of the guys hit high draws for more distance, but what Jayden has is pure class. We'll be seeing him right at the top in the future.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nSchaper is the first junior in South African golfing history to achieve the ‘grand slam’ of Nomads SA Boys titles, winning the U-13, U-15 and U-17 tournaments and the elusive double at the Nomads SA Boys U-19 Championship as a 16-year-old at Langebaan Golf Club in 2017.<br><br>\r\n\r\nLast year he won the SA Stroke Play Championship, shooting a course record 63 at De Zalze Golf Club en route to victory in the high-ranking international event. And, in addition to five more wins on the GolfRSA Open Amateur circuit, the 18-year-old Benoni golfer became the first South African to win the Junior Players Championship – considered among the most prestigious junior golf tournaments in the world.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSchaper was gunning to become the first amateur to win the South African Open since Denis Hutchinson in 1959, staying close to the lead through three rounds before finishing tied for sixth at 13 under par.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SAOpen?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#SAOpen</a> AMATEUR WATCH&#10240;<br>HOLED IT &#128074;&#127995;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GolfRSA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@golfrsa</a> No 1 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/schaperjayden?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@schaperjayden</a> birdies the 18th for 1-under 70 & a 13-under finish!!<br>Top 6 for the 2020 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FreddieTaitCup?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#FreddieTaitCup</a> &#127942; winner in his debut in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SAOpen_Golf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SAOpen_Golf</a> hosted by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CityofJoburgZA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CityofJoburgZA</a> at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RandparkGolf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@RandparkGolf</a> &#128079;&#127995;&#128079;&#127995;&#128079;&#127995;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/itstartshere?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#itstartshere</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/golfrsa?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#golfrsa</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/wjIlcVQYhL\">pic.twitter.com/wjIlcVQYhL</a></p>— Lali Stander (@LaliStander) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LaliStander/status/1216356819343433729?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 12, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><br>\r\n\r\nNot since Ernie Els in 1989 had an amateur finished in the top six of the world’s second oldest championship.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“That’s a pretty big name. Ernie is someone I’ve looked up to because he has been one of the most consistent golfers to play the game. It’s pretty cool to see my name up there with his and other names like that,” said Schaper. “It was a special week, and one that I’ll never forget.”<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I’m glad I could keep my cool in such a pressure environment in a tournament like this. Just to show I can compete with these guys, in just my second European Tour start. I still have lots to learn and I’m grateful for the opportunity.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nExpect many more opportunities in the years ahead for Jayden Schaper, who could turn out to be next South African star to follow in the footsteps of Ernie Els, Retief Goosen, Charl Schwartzel and Oosthuizen.",

Only three of the 18 holes were tied.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt started on the first hole when Farnam doubled to give Hathcoat the lead. After a Farnam birdie tied it up, he tripled the par-5 3rd to fall behind again by three shots.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAgain Farnam responded with a birdie to pull closer, but a double at the 5th -- while Hathcoat was making birdie -- resulted in another three-shot swing and put Hathcoat five ahead.<br><br>\r\n\r\nGive Farnam credit -- every time he suffered a blow-up hole he bounced back with a birdie, and he did again on the sixth as the comeback was on.

    "title": "Callaway MAVRIK Fairway Woods Review",
    "teaser": "Our staff tested all three of the new A.I.-designed MAVRIK Fairway models, the Standard, Sub Zero, and forgiving MAX",
    "articleText": "A new supercomputer arrived at Callaway's world headquarters last year, and they turned it loose not just on drivers, but fairway woods too. <br><br>\r\n\r\nCallaway MAVRIK Fairways are the first fairways the company has turned out with faces fully optimized by Artificial Intelligence. Using the company’s second-generation supercomputer and machine learning, thousands of iterations of potential face designs are (virtually) suggested and tested, with 99.9% of just a few surviving to be turned into physical prototypes. That’s far cry from the old days, when models were made and tested by actual golfers. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe benefit for the golfer? Now Callaway’s MAVRIK fairway woods are being even further refined to maximize their distance, launch, and forgiveness, the same way that drivers were starting with the Epic Flash.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k3tLhpaebDs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br><br>\r\n\r\nFurther, each of Callaway’s three MAVRIK Fairway wood models has a face designed specifically for its size, shape, and CG location — enough variables to make their new supercomputer pay back a chance of it’s multi-million dollar investment.  But these complicated (and thin) face design options which the machine “learned” to design require new materials to produce optimal ball flight and stand up to thousands of real-world shots. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059558.jpg\" alt=\"Callaway MAVRIK Fairway Woods\"></div>\r\n\r\nTo handle these demands, Callaway chose an exotic called C300 maraging steel. It is both resilient and very strong; and the ball speed gains provided are significant. Each model has Jailbreak Technology (two vertical internal bars that provide stability and efficiency) as well as enhanced Face Cups and lightweight carbon crowns. These two features provide optimal CG designs and increased distance across the face. You won’t need a supercomputer to notice the difference, but you might need to rethink some of those par-5s you’ve never been able to go for in two before.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNow that we’ve discussed the shared benefits of the new line, here is a breakdown of the three new MAVRIK Fairway models:<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>MAVRIK Fairway Wood</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059561.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><div style=\"text-align:center; font-size:14px;\">- Callaway photo</div>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\nThe “standard” model MAVRIK Fairway Wood is the fastest in the line, with an expansive hitting area that provides a high launch and piercing trajectory. That’s perfect for most players, who don’t want to work too hard to pinch a fairway wood off of tight lies, but don’t want a club that hits it so high it doesn’t go anywhere. If you want a 7-wood, you can order a 7-wood. (You can even order a MAVRIK 7-wood!) But an everyday off-the-deck or off-a-tee three wood is an indispensable, core part of your “head cover” arsenal.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTechnically, there are a few key features that make MAVRIK standard fairways tick. All lofts incorporate a single, visible, fixed weight in the sole, center-back, to pull the CG low and back in the head for that high launching but piercing trajectory I mentioned earlier. The progressive leading edge geometry adds to the ball speed design, and a generous heel camber is suited for versatility. You don’t want your heel getting stuck in the ground or pinched by light rough, after all.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe bottom line? MAVRIK standard is likely going to fit most low to mid-handicap golfers, and will definitely find its way into some Tour bags as well. <br><br>\r\n\r\nMAVRIK standard models of fairway woods can be ordered in 3+, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 7-wood.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>MAVRIK Sub Zero Fairway Wood</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059563.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><div style=\"text-align:center; font-size:14px;\">- Callaway photo</div>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\nThe stronger player should definitely take a hard look at the Sub Zero model of MAVRIK Fairway when considering which model is the best fit. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe MAVRIK Sub Zero fairway has the most compact head the three models, along with a face shape preferred by pros and lower handicap players. The leading edge architecture in the Sub Zero has been redesigned to be sharper and allow those who don’t have any trouble placing the club face on the ball consistently off the ground with the option to pinch it just right for better workability either way. MAVRIK Sub Zero fairways also have interchangeable weights (14g and 2g) in the sole at center-back and center-front to adjust launch angle and spin-rate.<br><br> \r\n\r\nThey are available in 3+, 3-, 4-, and 5-wood.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>MAVRIK MAX Fairway Wood</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059564.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><div style=\"text-align:center; font-size:14px;\">- Callaway photo</div>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\nHere’s a club I really enjoyed testing for a couple of reasons. First off, for a club called “MAX” it really looks good at address and sits pretty square. There’s no question it’s on the larger side for a fairway wood, but not to the point of being off-putting. It may be the largest of the three models, but it’s also the most forgiving. And inside, it’s designed to promote a draw and my fairway wood miss is usually low and right (sound familiar) so it might be a good fit for me.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAnother thing I like about the MAX is that you have the chance to experiment with lighter shafts. Those are coming into vogue in drivers, but haven’t been pushed as much in fairways. But why not? I found that lightweight 60g shaft in the MAX Fairway was really easy to swing.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOn the technical side, MAVRIK MAX fairways come with interchangeable weights in the sole at center-back to promote easy launch, and at the heel to promote a draw. The forgiveness I spoke about earlier comes from a significantly higher MOI measurement than Epic Flash Fairways. Also, the face is shaped with a wider radius at the bottom to create more hitting area in the lower heal and toe regions, where anyone that struggles with solid contact needs it. And the leading edge is noticeably lower for significantly better performance on shots that are hit low on the face. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe MAVRIK MAX can be ordered in 3+, 3-, 5-, Heavenwood, 7-, 9-, and 11-wood.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>MORE INFORMATION</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nPre-order date: January 14, 2020<br>Product at Retail: January 23, 2020<br>Pricing: $299 each",

    "articleText": "Before you dismiss the distance gains and increased forgiveness of the new MAVRIK Irons as being the result of strong lofts and longer shaft lengths — like some traditionalists can often be heard grumbling in response to manufacturers’ iron distance claims — I suggest you give them a try first.<br><br>\r\n\r\nProvided with a mixed bag of mostly drivers and fairways to test in advance of the MAVRIK product launch, I went out to play a few holes. After a par-5 and two par 4s, I found myself facing a 195 yard shot on a tricky par-3 at San Jose’s Coyote Creek, I pondered the choices in front of me. Let’s see, there were three different 3-woods. I could always saw one of those off. But from my “gamers” I had only brought 7-wedge to keep my golf bag under the 50 pound flight limit.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSo there they were, three MAVRIK 6-irons -- one of each new model.  I usually hit 6-iron about 175, maybe 180. What’s 20 yards I figured? And the miss was short anyway. So I grabbed the \"MAX\" model and teed it up slightly higher than normal (more like Hybrid height) and closed my stance a little. Putting a full turn on it, I caught one high-toe and watched it hit the front of the green and release to 10 feet past the flag. My playing partner shook his head. <br><br>\r\n\r\n\"Technology,\" he groaned.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059579.jpg\" alt=\"Callaway MAVRIK Irons\"></div>\r\nSure, drivers seem to get all the attention. But some of the biggest gains in golf club technology have taken place in the clubs you count on more often -- the irons. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd while I'm not sure that the MAX model is the right one for me, I can say with some assurance that the technology in all three new MAVRIK models has me rethinking my forged clubs altogether. I'm ready to hit an 8-iron from 160 again! <br><br>\r\n\r\nBut all of that technology isn't worth anything if you don't get the kind of feedback from a good shot that goes beyond the result (although I don't think any of us mind seeing a slight \"miss\" carry the water no matter how it feels). The millions of urethane microspheres inside the MAVRIK series act as the glue that brings everything together - absorbing vibration while maximizing distance. The 6-iron I hit on the par-3 was the perfect example. It felt a bit high and on the toe, but I didn't get the kind of hollow, twisting vibration in my hands that says \"this ball is hooking into the short left bunker.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nSo if I've got you intrigued, let's look at the shared features of all three models, and then dive into each one individually.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Industry-leading Ball Speeds From Flash Face Cup Technology</b><br>\r\nA.I. machine learning helped Callaway creat a sophisticated face architecture that’s unique to every loft, promoting higher ball speeds and increased spin robustness off of every iron. And ball speed is further enhanced by the 360 Face Cup that flexes and releases at impact.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Optimal Launch From Tungsten Energy Core</b><br>\r\nCustom tungsten-infused weights in each iron allowed Callaway's design engineers to locate the precisely position the CG in each iron while still maintaining ball speed in the Flash Face Cup. This promotes optimum launch and ball flight through the set, from strong lofts and player preferred trajectory, spin rates, and descent angles.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Unprecedented Feel From Urethane Microspheres</b><br>\r\nCallaway's patented urethane microspheres absorb unwanted vibration for pure feel, while also maximizing COR for increased ball speeds.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Premium Components</b><br>\r\nMAVRIK is available in stock premium shafts from True Temper, Project X and KBS with premium Golf Pride Grips.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>MAVRIK Irons</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059575.jpg\" alt=\"Callaway MAVRIK Irons\"></div>\r\nMAVRIK Irons will appeal to the widest diversity of players, with incredibly fast ball speeds from A.I and Flash Face architecture for consistent distance. To provide complete performance to match these distance technologies, each iron is engineered to optimize launch and trajectory while promoting player preferred trajectories, spin rates, and descent angles.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>MAVRIK Pro Irons</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059577.jpg\" alt=\"Callaway MAVRIK Pro Irons\"></div>\r\nThe MAVRIK Pro Irons feature a more compact head shape, flatter lie angle and thinner topline that better players prefer for better workability and control. The look is similar to the Epic Forged irons; if you're looking for a \"small sports car\" then MAVRIK Pro may be for you.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>MAVRIK MAX Irons</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059578.jpg\" alt=\"Callaway MAVRIK MAX Irons\"></div>\r\nIf you’re looking for distance from your irons, and maybe a little help getting it airborne, it doesn’t matter what the loft or length is. Results count. The MAVRIK MAX is a large headed, majorly offset distance iron that is has hybrid-like tendencies. A cup face to drive ball speed, and a lightweight shaft to match. (And this one wasn’t even graphite; I’m looking forward to trying that combination.)<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>SUMMARY</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nNow, many of you reading AmateurGolf.com are going to err on the side of traditional when it comes to irons. And in fairness, unless you bought forged blades, if you’ve purchased a set of irons from any of the “majors” lately you’re likely getting some cool distance technology in more subtle ways. Technologies like distribution of tungsten weight and face cups, can be found in Apex Pro 19 Callaway irons as just one example.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut the three new MAVRIK models really push the boundaries of what's possible in an iron. As the Callaway tagline goes, they offer \"MAVRIK distance in every face.\" They are available for pre-order on January 14, with a product-at-retail date of February 6.",

    "title": "Callaway introduces three new MAVRIK Hybrids",
    "teaser": "Available in Standard, Pro, and MAX, the new models push the boundaries of the hybrid category",
    "articleText": "Today Callaway announced three new MAVRIK Hybrids: Standard, Pro, and MAX. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAs with their new MAVRIK fairways, it's the first time the company used A.I. to create fully optimized hybrid faces. Adding to the equation Callaway's proven Jailbreak and Face Cup technologies and the result is the most technologically advanced hybrid face the company has ever designed. The new MAVRIK hybrids are long, forgiving, and easy to launch.<br><br>\r\n\r\nCallaway is now on their second generation supercomputer. They used A.I.'s machine learning to develop a different face design for every loft of the MAVRIK hybrid (across each model), promoting an optimal combination of speed, launch angle, and spin rate. These are the first Callaway hybrids to feature a fully optimized Flash Face, which is better at delivering fast ball speed across the entire hitting area.<br><br>\r\n\r\nContributing to MAVRIK hybrids ability to deliver distance is Callaway’s unparalleled Jailbreak technology. Two vertical bars behind the face connect the sole and crown, allowing the face to take on more impact load; Jailbreak’s innovative ability to promote distance provides another key advantage in the production of ball speed.<br><br>\r\n\r\nEach MAVRIK model is designed to offer precisely what golfers want from a hybrid: easy launch, high flight, long carry and soft landing. And they are all equipped with premium shaft and grip components. Here's a quick look at each one:<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>MAVRIK Hybrid</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059583.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\nThat standard model is characterized by a mid-sized head with a square toe and justified scoring lines -- analogous to an iron face. The low CG, high MOI and speed-enhancing technologies combine to make MAVRIK easy to play. Long approaches, long par-threes and second shots on par-fives just became a lot more fun. Available in 3H, 4H, 5H, and 6H. Stock components include Project X Catalyst shaft in 55g, 65g, and 75g.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>MAVRIK MAX Hybrid</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059584.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\nThe MAVRIK MAX is similar in shape to the Standard model, but with a larger body and deeper CG for higher MOI that makes them noticeably easy to launch. A wide range of lofts gives higher handicappers the option to replace all the way up to their 7- or 8-iron with the easy launch and long distance of MAVRIK MAX hybrids. Lofts include 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H, 7H, and 8H. Stock components include Project X Catalyst shaft in 55g, 65g, and 75g.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>MAVRIK Pro Hybrid</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059582.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\nThe compact size, smaller profile, shallower face and cambered sole make the Pro closer to a fairway wood shape than an iron shape. Callaway returned to a fairway-wood like shape at the request of better players, including Tour pros, who prefer the flatter lie-angle and versatility of the increased sole-camber, as well as a neutral CG and more neutral ball flight. <br><br>\r\n\r\nMAVRIK Hybrids are available for pre-order on January 14, with a product-at-retail date of January 23.",

We believe that our new format will resonate with both men and women players and bring an entirely new dynamic to our tournament.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nFor more than 90 years, the Southwestern Amateur was contested at clubs throughout the southwestern United States.  In 2020, tournament officials and the management of the Desert Mountain Club signed a five-year agreement for the club to host the event on two of its Jack Nicklaus-designed courses in extreme northeast Scottsdale offering dramatic Sonoran Desert scenery at the foot of the McDowell Mountains.<br><br>\r\n\t\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00057784.jpg\"><span id=\"ContentPlaceHolder1_labArticleImageCaption\" class=\"caption\"><br/>The Cochise Course (Desert Mountain photo)<br/><br/></div>\r\n\r\nOne of the premier golf clubs in the entire world, Desert Mountain has also been the home to multiple professional tournaments including the Champions Tour Charles Schwab Cup in 2012 and 2014-2016.<br><br>\r\n\t\r\nThe 2020 event – scheduled to be played June 17-20 – will be contested on Desert Mountain’s Cochise and Chiricahua courses which are recognized for their risk/reward par-5s, dramatic rock outcroppings and stunning views to the south of the greater Phoenix area.<br><br>\r\n\t\r\nMany college coaches have responded positively to the new format.  Matt Thurmond, head men’s coach at Arizona State University, said, “The Southwestern Amateur has taken a bold step in creating a unique tournament that will provide some of the country’s top men and women collegiate players, as well as mid-amateurs, with an opportunity to showcase their skills in a one-of-a-kind competition on two spectacular golf courses.<br><br>\r\n\t\r\n<table align=\"right\" width=\"315\" border=\"1\" bordercolor=\"#d69629\" style=\"margin-left:10px; margin-bottom:10px\">\r\n<tr>\r\n<td align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00051773.jpg\"><br><br>\r\n<b>2020 Southwestern Amateur</b><br><br>\r\nJune 17-20, 2020<br><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://desertmountain.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Desert Mountain Golf Club</a><br>Cochise and Chiricahua Courses<br><br>\r\nField Size: 144 (72 men, 72 women)<br><br>\r\nMax Index: 1.4 men, 3.2 women<br><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://swga.net/entry-information\" target=\"_blank\">ENTRY INFORMATION</a>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\nDana Dormann, the head women’s coach at San Jose State University, also endorsed the new Southwestern Amateur format.  “Out-of-the-box thinking has not always been a hallmark for amateur golf – especially when it pertains to women players.  Over the course of the last few years, the Augusta National Women’s Amateur and the Golf Channel’s coverage of the women’s NCAA championships have markedly increased the exposure of our sport.  The Southwestern Amateur’s new format is another great opportunity for us to showcase the talents of the many outstanding female amateurs from throughout the country.”<br><br>\r\n\t\r\nWith a field size of 144 players, the Southwestern Amateur will be a highly selective event, with male applicants having a maximum index of 1.4 and a 3.2 index for women.<br><br>\r\n\t\r\nIn addition to playing on two of the most spectacular layouts in all of the country, the Southwestern Amateur offers players a number of opportunities not always available at other events, including complimentary hosted housing at Desert Mountain, free use of golf carts during the 72-hole competition, and an opportunity to “hopefully compete against some of the best men and women amateur players in the world,” Ranslem concluded.",

The result is a rebalanced putter for improved tempo and consistency\r\nin the stroke. Tour player testing showed a 20% more consistent length of backswing and a\r\n14% more consistent velocity at impact. Overall, testing with the Stroke Lab shaft showed a\r\n13% increase in overall stroke consistency. In a game of inches, these are some very\r\nimpressive numbers.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFor 2020, Odyssey has unveiled their line of Stroke Lab Black Putters: seven of Odyssey’s most popular putter\r\ndesigns in a rich black PVD finish featuring the tempo enhancing Stroke Lab shaft.

Callaway knew this was a problem and\r\nemployed the expertise of researchers at the St. Louis College of Optometry to perfect what\r\nthey call Triple Track Technology. Through rigorous testing and R&D development, they found\r\nthat golfers statistically are seeing vast improvements with their putting when using Triple Track\r\nlines.<br><br>\r\n\r\nLast year, Callaway introduced this new alignment improvement technology on their ERC Soft\r\nand Chrome Soft X golf balls. Triple Track is as simple as it sounds. It’s three lines in total, two\r\nparallel thin blue lines with a thicker red line running between them. Triple Track Technology\r\nutilizes Vernier Hyper Acuity, the same visual technology used to land planes on aircraft\r\ncarriers.

    "teaser": "Titleist took player feedback and tweaked the T100 irons, creating a fully-forged player iron that produces greater distance",
    "articleText": "After 5 generations of AP irons over a span of 10 years, Titleist introduced\r\nus to a line of player irons with so many new design elements it needed a\r\nnew name. We tested the newest Titleist T100 irons back in August of\r\n2019, and our staff absolutely loved them.<br><br>\r\n\r\nCompetitive amateurs will likely be most interested in the T100 series. It’s a\r\nset of irons comparable to Titleist’s AP2 model but with a slightly smaller\r\nblade, a thinner topline and a little less offset. Titleist carried over many of\r\nthe features that made AP2 so popular including the strategic use of\r\ntungsten weighting.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFor 2020, the engineers at Titleist took their player feedback and have\r\nmade a slight tweak to the T100 irons creating a fully-forged player iron that\r\nmost certainly produces greater distance.<br><br>\r\n\r\nModeled after the tour-refined design of the new Titleist T100 models, the\r\nnew T100•S irons are calibrated with 2-degree stronger lofts to give better\r\nplayers more distance, while maintaining the feel and precision of the\r\noriginal T100 design. The stock shaft for the T100•S is the True Temper\r\nProjext X LZ, a mid-launch, low spin, 120g shaft. If the Project X is not for\r\nyou, Titleist offers a number of custom shaft choices at no upcharge.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“T100•S was developed as a Player’s Distance iron with an emphasis on\r\nthe word Player’s. We’ve taken the most popular irons on the PGA Tour and\r\ncarefully engineered them to maximize distance,” said Josh Talge, Vice\r\nPresident, Titleist Golf Club Marketing. “As we were launching the new T-\r\nSeries, we met a lot of golfers who were really excited about T100 but had\r\nbecome accustomed to playing stronger-lofted iron sets. It would have been\r\nreally easy to just take T100’s and bend them stronger for those players.\r\nBut by doing that you start to sacrifice the incredible feel and turf interaction\r\n– the reasons why players were gravitating toward them in the first place.\r\nSo our engineers went back and redesigned each individual iron to give\r\nthese players the stronger lofts and distance they’re looking for, while\r\npreserving the performance of that pure forged shape and sole.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nAvailable irons: 3 (19º), 4 (22º), 5 (25º), 6 (28º), 7 (32º), 8 (36º), 9 (40º), P\r\n(44º), W48.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBeginning March 12, golfers can try the T100•S irons by attending a Titleist\r\nFitting and Trial event (including Titleist Thursdays), being held at hundreds\r\nof locations nationwide. You can learn more and setup a fitting at\r\nhttps://www.titleist.com/fitting/appointments.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNew Titleist T-Series T100•S irons will be available in golf shops worldwide\r\nbeginning March 27, with fittings beginning March 12. MAP $175 per club\r\n($1399/set of 8).",

    "teaser": "The 108-player field is competing for coveted invitations to both the Masters and the British Open",
    "articleText": "Ivan Camilo Ramirez overcame a bumpy start to turn in a sparkling 3-under-par 68 on Thursday, taking the lead after round one of the Latin America Amateur Championship (LAAC) at El Camaleón Golf Club. Chileans Lukas Roessler and Gabriel Morgan Birke are tied for second place, two strokes back at 1 under.\r\n\r\nRamirez, a 22-year-old Colombian, bogeyed two of his first three holes but then caught fire in the middle of his round. Five birdies in a seven-hole stretch rocketed him to the top of the leader board and he parred his final seven holes to claim the 18-hole lead on a day so blustery that only three players in the field broke par.\r\n\r\nThe spark for Ramirez’s round came on the par-5 fifth hole. After hitting his second shot just over the green, Ramirez chipped back and made a tricky 12-footer for his first birdie of the day.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“With that putt, I felt like something good was coming,” Ramirez said. “The putter kept me in the round.”\r\n\r\nRamirez, who has played in all five previous editions of the LAAC, credited his comfort at El Camaleón in part to a series of practice rounds that he and his Colombian teammates played earlier this month at TPC Cartagena – a course with similar grass and wind. He also said that playing his college golf at Texas Tech University was a benefit, as he learned to deal with Texas’s ever-present breezes.\r\n\r\n“I feel like I have all the shots in my bag,” he said.\r\n\r\nUnlike Ramirez, who was among the final players on the course, Birke and Roessler teed off in the morning. Roessler, at just 15 years of age, is one of the youngest players in the field but is quite familiar with the LAAC all the same as his older brother, Toto Gana, was the 2017 champion at Club de Golf de Panama.\r\n\r\nRoessler was steady for most the round, birdieing two holes on the front nine and then chipping in for birdie on the 11th before stumbling just a bit on his way in with bogeys on the 12th and 14th. Birke’s experience was similar, as he started on the 10th and played his first 14 holes in 3 under only to bogey Nos. 6 and 7.\r\n\r\nBirke said he was not surprised that many players struggled to figure out the winds that whipped through the course because the directions were often the opposite of what they were during the players’ practice rounds.\r\n\r\n“What surprises me most is that the tournament here, when it’s played on the PGA Tour, they win with scores of 22 under par,” Birke said. “I have no idea how they could accomplish that.”\r\n\r\nMexico’s Aaron Terrazas led the charge for the host country, finishing in a tie for fourth following a 1-over-par 72.",

Jones/Doherty Women’s Amateur Championship at Coral Ridge Country Club always has her in a good mood.\r\n\r\nAnd it’s not just because she usually goes back to her Lake Worth home with a trophy.\r\n\r\nPano, 15, won her second straight Amateur division title and her third in the last four years, defeating Courtney McKim of Raleigh, N.C., 4 and 3, on a blustery, sometimes rainy Friday morning in the 88th edition of the prestigious tournament.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“It feels pretty good,” said Pano, who won the Amateur First Flight title when she was 9. “I always feel happy when I’m playing in this golf tournament. To start off the year with a win is a great start.\r\n\r\n“It’s really nice to come back to defend. Every tournament, my goal is to win, so to repeat is really nice.”\r\n\r\nIn the Senior Championship division, top-seeded Judith Kyrinis of Thornhill, Ontario, defeated Corey Weworski of Carlsbad, California, on the first extra hole.\r\n\r\nDown by three holes, Kyrinis won 13 and 15 with pars, and sent the match into overtime by sinking a 15-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole. She and Weworski returned to the first hole, where Kyrinis sank another 15-footer for birdie and the victory.\r\n\r\n“I just made them at the right time. I’ve really been putting well all week,” said Kyrinis, a former U.S. Senior Women’s Amateur champion who birdied the final hole last year to win the Canadian Mid-Amateur and Senior Women’s Championship. “I knew anything could happen on some of those back-nine holes.”\r\n\r\nIn the Senior First Flight, Therese Quinn of Jacksonville defeated Natalie McNicholas of Naples, 2 up. In the Senior Second Flight title match, Mimi Hoffman of Springfield, Va., beat Mo Sheehan of Grayslake, Ill., 2 up.\r\n\r\nMcKim, 29, who runs the corporate real estate division of a medical company, went back and forth with Pano over the first seven holes. Pano sank an 8-foot par-saving putt to win the first hole, but McKim won the next two holes with pars to go 1 up.\r\n\r\n“It was a bit of a struggle in the beginning figuring out the wind,” Pano said. “I kind of found a rhythm toward the middle of the round.”\r\n\r\nPano hit a lovely pitch to the par-5 fourth green and sank the birdie putt to square the match, and the players halved the next two holes with pars. McKim went ahead with a great birdie of her own after pitching her third shot to about five feet from the pin on the par-5 seventh hole.\r\n\r\nMcKim’s tee shot on the par-3 eighth landed in thick rough next to a bunker and the ball came out sideways and rolled to the bottom of the two-tiered green. McKim pitched the ball from there close to the hole, but Pano, whose tee shot landed on the top tier, two-putted for a par to pull even.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nA turning point came on the long, par-4 ninth hole. Pano’s tee shot kicked into a bush and she had to take an unplayable and a one-shot penalty. She dropped the ball in the right rough, then hit a 3-wood 225 yards that ended up four feet from the flag. McKim, who also reached the green in three, missed her par putt and Pano made hers to take a 1-up lead.\r\n\r\n“She played an unbelievable shot after taking an unplayable,” McKim said. “Hats off to her on that. That’s just crazy good.”\r\n\r\n“Being able to save par definitely shifted the momentum my way and carried over to the back nine,” Pano said. “It was probably the best shot of the day and one I’ll never forget.”\r\n\r\nMcKim bogeyed the 10th after hitting into a fairway bunker – “I struggled with my driver all day,” she said – and coming up short of the green with her second shot to go 2 down. Pano then won her fourth straight hole, making birdie at the par-5 11th after her 70-yard pitch settled three feet from the hole.\r\n\r\nPano’s tee shot at the par-3 12th plugged in a bunker and McKim won the hole with a two-putt par. But Pano went back to 3 up with a 4-foot birdie putt on the par-5 13th, and her two-putt par on the 14th gave her a four-hole lead with four to play.\r\n\r\nAt the par-4 15th, McKim’s approach landed about 15 feet from the hole while Pano’s went over the green. But she chipped to within 18 inches, and after McKim missed her birdie try, Pano rolled in the short par putt to close out the match.\r\n\r\n“I knew I had to get it tight. Especially with Courtney having a birdie putt,” said Pano, who had three birdies and three bogeys in 15 holes. “To be around even par for those holes, especially in that wind, was pretty good.”\r\n\r\nAnd she’s got another trophy to prove it.",

    "teaser": "The 26-year-old regional director of sales for Trackman is atop a field of mostly future professionals after a wind-proof 65",
    "articleText": "Jose Vega used an early hole-out for eagle to jump-start a sizzling round of 65 on Friday, seizing the lead at three-under par after 36 holes of the Latin America Amateur Championship (LAAC) at Mayakoba’s El Camaelón Golf Club in Mexico. Vega, a 26-year-old Colombian, is three shots ahead of Lukas Roessler of Chile at even par, with Chile’s Gabriel Morgan Birke and Argentina’s Abel Gallegos tied for third place, four strokes behind at one over.\r\n\r\nVega’s 65 on the par-71 layout ties for the fourth-lowest single-round score in LAAC history and is the tied for the second-lowest second-round total in championship history, trailing only Joaquin Niemann’s 64 in the second round of the 2018 LAAC at Prince of Wales Country Club in Chile.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nIt started with Vega pouring in a birdie putt on No. 1 before he saw his wedge approach on the par-4 third take one bounce and disappear for an unexpected eagle. Vega added three more birdies and did not record a bogey on a day that, for mostly everyone else, was difficult for scoring.\r\n\r\n“I think it was one of the best rounds I’ve ever played,” Vega said. “And playing on a stage like this, it’s even better.”\r\n\r\nVega, who grew up in Medellin, played college golf at Bellevue University in Nebraska until 2015, but now works as a regional director of sales for Trackman, a popular golf technology company. While he only plays a handful of tournaments, he still spends much of his time around the golf course, working with top players in the professional ranks.\r\n\r\nAnd while he called golf more of a “hobby” for himself these days, Vega also did not hesitate when asked if he believes he can hold onto his lead over the final 36 holes.\r\n\r\n“Absolutely,” he said. “My mind and my way of living is just a competitive mindset. … I’m not here to be second. I’m not here to be third. I’m here to win.”\r\n\r\nVega was one of only five players to break par in the second round, as winds whipped through the Riviera Maya and gusts reached up to 35 mph. At one point, Birke was forced to remove his hat before he hit his approach on No. 14 because it would not stay on his head; Colombia’s Ivan Camilo Ramirez, the first-round leader now tied for fifth at two over, said the wind “blows sideways” and made it “hard to trust the line and commit” as players considered their shots.\r\n\r\nFifty-two players representing 20 different countries ultimately made the 36-hole cut, which came at 13-over-par 155. El Salvador’s Rodrigo Sol, who sits at nine over, is the first player from his country to play the weekend at a LAAC, while Chile led all countries with eight players qualifying for the weekend.\r\n\r\nThe host country is also well-represented, as seven of the 11 Mexican players in the field qualified for the weekend. They are led by Aaron Terrazas, who is tied for seventh at four over.",

Play then moved to the Nicklaus Course for the final two rounds, where scoring was much more difficult, with just two under-par rounds recorded. Wright shot a 77 on day two to bring him back to the pack, tied with Jerry Rose (Sarasota, Fla.) for the lead.\r\n\r\nWhen Wright doubled the par-three 5th in the final round, he suddenly found himself one shot behind Steve Harwell (Mooresville, N.C.), but he steadied himself from there, going one under the rest of the way, while Harwell dropped four shots in the middle of his round to fall back.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHarwell's birdie and Wright's bogey at the par-four 17th made it a one-shot margin heading to the final hole, where Wright was able to match his opponent's closing birdie to seal the win.\r\n\r\nWright closed with a 73 for a 2-under 214 total, with Harwell (71) one shot back in solo second.\r\n\r\nDecker shot 73 to finish third, with Jack Kearney (Peachtree City, Ga.) and Rusty Strawn (McDonough, Ga.) rounding out the top five.\r\n\r\nCraig Hurlbert (Magnolia, Texas) continued his fine play to start 2020, finishing 6th to go along with two wins and a tie for fifth so far.\r\n\r\nMark Weston (Windermere, Fla.) won the Super Senior division by four shots over Bev Hargraves (Little Rock, Ark.).\r\n\r\nFred Clark (Mobile, Ala.) was the Legend division winner, edging out John Osborne (Vero Beach, Fla.) by two shots.\r\n\r\nIn the Super Legends division, Charlie Busbee (Stockbridge, Ga.) completed a one-shot win over Steve Wilson (Solana Beach, Calif.).",

He is in fifth place, six strokes back.\r\n\r\nVega, who seized the lead with a blistering second-round 65 on Friday afternoon, is a former college golfer who now works as a regional director of sales for Trackman, a golf technology company. While Vega readily admits that playing golf is more a passion than a potential profession at this stage of his life – he is 26 – he still believes he can finish off this unlikely run and claim the prizes that come with being a LAAC champion, including exemptions into the Masters Tournament and The 149th Open later this year.\r\n\r\nHe is under no illusions, however, that it will be easy.\r\n\r\n“When I step up on the first tee tomorrow, it’s going to be a grind,” he said. “The one that is going to take the trophy home is the one that makes fewer mistakes.”\r\n\r\nGallegos will begin closest to him, and the 17-year-old from a small town of just 25,000 people outside Buenos Aires is one of South America’s top talents. Despite having just a single nine-hole course – named Las Mulitas, or Little Mules – on which he could learn the game, Gallegos was named Argentina’s junior golfer of the year in 2019 and is playing in his first LAAC after finishing sixth in the Junior Orange Bowl earlier this month.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nWith a swing speed that is routinely around 125 mph and a confident short game, Gallegos has been unflappable this week, especially of late; he has birdied the 18th hole in two of his three rounds, and when he holed his final putt this afternoon, he put himself in exactly the position he wanted.\r\n\r\n“My goal was to have a chance on Sunday,” Gallegos said. “I think I fulfilled that. Now I just need to trust myself.”\r\n\r\nAmong other low scores on Saturday, Mexico’s Emilio Gonzalez (69) joined Gallegos as the only players to shoot under par in the third round. Gonzalez is tied for ninth with Peru’s Julian Perico, who shot a third-round 72.",

    "teaser": "The first Latin America champion from Argentina will receive invites to the 2020 Masters, British Open",
    "articleText": "PLAYA DEL CARMEN, Mexico – Argentina’s Abel Gallegos used a devastating combination of power and panache to claim his country’s first victory at the Latin America Amateur Championship on Sunday, shooting a dazzling four-under-par 67 to win by four strokes at Mayakoba’s El Camaleón Golf Club. Mexico’s Aaron Terrazas inspired the home fans with a thrilling late charge and a 67 to finish runner-up, while Colombia’s Jose Vega shot 74 to take third place.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith the victory, the 17-year-old Gallegos becomes the second-youngest LAAC champion and earns exemptions into a pair of especially coveted tournaments: the 2020 Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club in April and The 149th Open at Royal St George’s in July. He can also play in The Amateur Championship, the U.S. Amateur and any other USGA amateur event for which he is eligible, including the final stage of qualifying for the 120th U.S. Open at Winged Foot.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“It was an amazing day,” Gallegos said. “It was difficult to get up in the morning, knowing I had all this pressure. … Last night, when I put my head on the pillow, I had all types of thoughts running through my head. But when I woke up, I stood up, I looked at myself in the mirror and I said, ‘You can do this. Let’s do it.’”<br><br>\r\n\r\nGallegos, who hails from the small town of 25 de Mayo, about two hours outside of Buenos Aires, learned the game on a modest nine-hole course named Las Mulitas, or Little Mules, but will be the 14th Argentine and just the third amateur from Argentina to compete in the Masters Tournament.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"es\" dir=\"ltr\">¡Abel Gallegos (Argentina) es el campeón del Latin America Amateur Championship 2020!<br><br>Abel Gallegos of Argentina is the 2020 Latin America Amateur Champion! <a href=\"https://t.co/wybuxhiV7W\">pic.twitter.com/wybuxhiV7W</a></p>— LAAC (@LAAC_Golf) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LAAC_Golf/status/1218967314793746433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 19, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><br>\r\n\r\nAngel Cabrera, the Argentine legend who won the 2009 Masters, sent a message to Gallegos after the final round in which he offered his congratulations and added, “I will be waiting for you at the Masters so you can enjoy that great tournament.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nGallegos smiled when told of Cabrera’s sentiment, saying, “He is a hero back home. To have him congratulate me, it is everything.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nVega made a surge in the middle of the championship, shooting 65 in the second round on Friday to seize the lead and held it after a 72 on Saturday. A former college golfer at Bellevue University in Nebraksa, he now works as a regional director of sales for Trackman, a popular golf technology company. When he first made plans for this event, he actually scheduled a business meeting on Sunday morning.<br><br>\r\n\r\nInstead, he was squarely in the mix for the title. Vega made a valiant effort to hold off Gallegos’s charge, but a double-bogey on No. 14 after a wayward drive into the penalty area made a comeback all but impossible.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I have seen a lot of good swings and a lot of good trajectories, and this kid is really good,” Vega said of Gallegos. “He is going to be a superstar and I hope he makes the cut in Augusta.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter three days of high winds on the Riviera Maya, the conditions for the final round were more conducive to scoring. The field produced just 10 rounds under par in the first three days combined, but 12 players broke par on the last day including Terrazas, who played one group in front of the leaders and birdied three of his last six holes to apply some pressure.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“I’m extremely proud of myself,” Terrazas said. “At the beginning of the day, I just wanted to give myself a shot on the back nine of this tournament and I did that.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nGallegos, however, couldn’t be caught. Starting the day two shots behind Vega, Gallegos made a slick par on the opening hole when he snaked an approach shot from out of the jungle up to the green while Vega bogeyed. Gallegos pulled level with a birdie on No. 3, then zoomed away from Vega and the rest of the field with masterful closing kick. Gallegos made just one double bogey all week and played his final 20 holes in six under par. He birdied the last hole to finish in style.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith Argentines having fallen just short of the title in two previous editions of the LAAC, there was a growing pressure for one of South America’s great golfing countries to finally win one.<br><br>\r\n\r\nGallegos delivered.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“For me, it’s an immense pride,” he said. “To put my country up there with the best is something that makes me very proud. Hopefully, more Argentinians will go on to win this tournament in the future.”",

    "teaser": "With a \"CG-forward\" design, the new wedges produce consistent flight and solid feel on full shots or around the green",
    "articleText": "It’s “gravity forward” for the new Titleist Vokey SM8 wedges.  How far forward?<br><br>\r\n\r\nTitleist says the CG hovers in front of the wedge face, in a place Bob Vokey said “we could have never imagined 20 years ago.” The effect for the golfer is that the wedges naturally want to stay square at impact. <br><br>\r\n\r\nMoving the CG forward was accomplished by lengthening the hosels and counterbalancing that weight with high-density tungsten low in the toe.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs with previous generations of Vokey wedges, Tour validation precedes the public launch. And Vokey was pleased with the initial feedback he got in 2019.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/upstF8rNutM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>\r\n\r\n“The first time I had guys hit SM8 was on the range at Riviera,” Vokey said, in a press release. “I always listen to the sound they’re making at impact, and it was phenomenal. ‘Solid but soft’ was how they described it… They also talked a lot about the flight. It’s in a better window, it’s more consistent, and they have more control of it. Overall, guys just kept telling me how easy it was to hit every type of shot they wanted to hit.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nLike the two previous  Vokey releasers, SM8 offers a progressive CG design to optimize the fight of each loft. The lower the loft, the lower the center of gravity. That way it’s easier for players to hit full wedge shots high and soft, with better flighting on the mid and short range shots from the higher lofts.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>PRODUCT DETAILS</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Spin Milled Grooves</b><br>\r\nSM8’s patented Spin Milled grooves are meticulously engineered and cut to the edge to maximize spin and shot control. The Vokey R&D team continues to improve upon its industry-leading groove cutting tolerances, with each groove on every head individually cut and 100% inspected for conformity to the rules of golf. Micro-grooves are individually cut in between grooves, which maximize spin on partial shots. A proprietary heat treatment is applied to the impact area to double the durability of the groove without impacting feel.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Refined Sole Grind Options</b><br>\r\nDeveloped through decades of work with the best shot makers in the game, Vokey’s six Tour-proven sole grinds – F, S, M, K, L and D – allow golfers of all skill levels to be precisely fit for their swing type (steep, neutral, shallow), shot making style and course conditions (firm, neutral, soft). SM8 continues to feature the most complete lineup of grind, bounce and loft options, allowing for more creativity and consistency, and giving players of any level the ability to create multiple shots around the green.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Set Makeup Suggestion: Watch What Tour Players Do</b><br>\r\nOne of Vokey’s preferred setups is pairing a higher bounce sand wedge (i.e. SM8 56.14 F) with a lower bounce lob wedge (i.e. SM8 60.08 M). This type of setup – which empowers a player to adjust to firm or soft conditions from the turf or in a bunker without having to change technique – is utilized by both Jordan Spieth (56.10 S and 60.04 L) and Justin Thomas (56.14 F, 60.06 K). Based on this insight, and current PGA Tour tends, the D Grind has been extended to the 54.12 and 56.12 SM8 models, providing players with versatile mid to high bounce sand wedge options.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Finishes</b><br>\r\nVokey SM8 wedges are available in Tour Chrome, Brushed Steel, Jet Black and Raw.<br><br> \r\n\r\n<b>Price and Availability</b><br>\r\nExpanded personalization options have been made available on Vokey’s WedgeWorks site. Vokey SM8 wedges have an MSRP of $159 each. and an at retail date of March 6.",

    "title": "Titleist unveils new Scotty Cameron Special Select Putters",
    "teaser": "New solid milled mid mallet and blade designs provide Tour-inspired confidence on the greens",
    "articleText": "Blending timeless designs with modern craftsmanship, Scotty Cameron's new Special Select putter line offers Tour-validated performance in eight new blade and mid-mallet setups. <br><br>\r\n\r\nSpecial Select putters -- precision milled in the USA. -- are inspired by the classic, solid milled designs that Master Putter Maker Scotty Cameron has crafted for tour players around the world – featuring sleeker putter head profiles with thinner and flatter toplines, refined neck configurations, soft tri-soles and performance balanced weighting.<br><br>\r\n\r\nEach Special Select putter has been completely reworked, including Scotty’s classic Newport, Newport 2 and Newport 2.5 blade styles. A refined Del Mar joins the new Fastback 1.5, Squareback 2, Flowback 5 and Flowback 5.5 mid-mallet models.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I’m always inspired by the putters that result from working directly with the best players in the world,” Cameron said. “With Special Select, I wanted to get back to the pure-milled shapes and faces that I’ve been crafting for tour players for over two decades now. We’ve brought those designs into the modern era with new setups, necks, faces, grips and weights. Every aspect of every putter has been redone. When it all came together, it was pretty special.” <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>SPECIAL SELECT PERFORMANCE & TECHNOLOGY</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nSpecial Select putters are meticulously crafted to provide pure performance and feel through the following key features:<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>TOUR-INSPIRED SHAPES</b><br>Sleeker putter head profiles with thinner, flatter toplines deliver confidence inspiring looks preferred by tour professionals.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>SOLID MILLED STAINLESS STEEL CONSTRUCTION</b><br>\r\nEvery Special Select is milled in the United States from a block of solid 303 stainless steel for legendary performance and playability with consistent sound and soft feel.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>SOFT TRI-SOLE DESIGN</b><br>\r\nSpecial Select blade models are milled with a tour-inspired soft tri-sole design. This self-soling feature promotes a proper setup at address while providing a stable, aesthetically pleasing view of the topline from the moment the putter is placed on the green.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>PERFORMANCE BALANCED WEIGHTING</b><br>\r\nNew performance balanced weighting expands on the use of Scotty’s interchangeable, customizable sole weights to tune the performance and feel of putters at all lengths. By directing more weight to the heel and toe, the sweet spot is enlarged and stability is enhanced back and through the stroke without compromising feel or each model’s unique toe flow properties. The blades come equipped with new tungsten sole weights, which allow for ultra-sleek, tour-validated shapes with larger sweet spots. The mid-mallets employ stainless steel sole weights for optimal balance and weight distribution.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>REFINED NECK CONFIGURATIONS</b><br>\r\nEach Special Select putter neck style has been revamped based on an intense and deliberate study in neck configurations. Newport, Newport 2 and Squareback 2 feature a slightly shorter plumbing neck for medium toe flow, with a newly-defined socket radius subtly repositioned with onset to provide clearer visibility of the leading edge at address. The Newport 2.5 and Fastback 1.5 each have a refined, toe flow-promoting small slant neck, while the rounded Flowback 5.5 comes with a new slantback neck for similar strokes. The heel-shafted Del Mar’s flow neck is designed for maximum toe flow. The GOLO-inspired Flowback 5 limits toe flow with a more traditional mid-bend, shaft-over-spud setup.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SPECIAL SELECT MODELS</b><br>\r\nThe Special Select line offers golfers the choice of three blade models and five mid-mallet options developed for every stroke style.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNewport, Newport 2, Newport 2.5 models feature an insert-free, solid milled 303 stainless steel putter head with performance balanced tungsten sole weighting for a larger sweet spot and increased stability. Flatter and thinner toplines, milled flange sight lines, soft tri-soles and redesigned plumbing (Newport, Newport 2) and small slant (Newport 2.5) neck styles round out these timeless blade designs.<br><br>\r\n\r\nA classic name returns with the new Special Select Del Mar in an updated heel-shafted, compact mallet model. Precision milled from solid 303 stainless steel, the new Del Mar features refined concave flange contours and a narrower, flatter topline for a player-preferred look at address, and customizable stainless steel sole weights. A left-handed Del Mar is also available.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNew Special Select Fastback 1.5, Squareback 2, Flowback 5 and Flowback 5.5 mid-mallet putters combine 6061 aircraft aluminum sole plates for optimal weight distribution with solid milled faces and interchangeable stainless steel sole weights. Each has a specific neck style – Fastback 1.5 (small slant), Squareback 2 (plumbing), Flowback (mid-bend shaft-over-spud) and Flowback 5.5 (slantback) – to facilitate better leading edge visibility from address, as well as desired toe flow properties.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>ACCESSORIES</b><br>\r\nEach Special Select putter is accessorized with a new Pistolini Plus grip in cement gray with distinctive white lettering that retains the Pistolini shape with a slightly built up lower hand profile. This new grip complements an elegantly embroidered, red abrasion-resistant Special Select headcover with superior wear characteristics.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>REFINED AESTHETICS</b><br>\r\nScotty gave the Special Select line’s raw stainless steel finish a unique bead blast for a radiant yet glare resistant appearance. Additionally, Scotty’s signature three red dot pattern on the back cavity has a new look. Each dot has been milled with a recessed circular channel, polished and then hand-painted with cherry red translucent paint, creating a striking new “cherry rings” feature. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>AVAILABILITY</b><br>\r\nSpecial Select putters will be available Jan. 24 in North America and March 27 worldwide through Titleist authorized golf shops.

    "articleText": "Purdue’s Cole Bradley played his last 11 holes in 5 under to fashion a final-round 68 and claim his second Jacksonville Area Golf Association (JAGA) First Coast Amateur title in the last three years at The Conservatory at Hammock Beach Resort. The Boilermaker junior posted rounds of 74-70-68-212 (4 under), with his final score coming on a blowing, 50-degree day in North Florida after two days of warm weather.<br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTying for second, a shot back, were University of North Florida sophomore Cody Carroll of Middleburg, Fla. and fall 2020 UNF commit Nicholas Gabrelcik of Trinity, Fla.<br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBradley, who won the 2018 title at Hidden Hills Country Club in Jacksonville in even cooler and more blustery conditions, came from two shots back on the last day.<br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCarroll, a co-leader after two rounds, shot 70-72-71-213 (-3) for his three trips around the 7,046-yard Tom Watson-designed Conservatory course.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe 17-year-old Gabrelcik carded 74-69-70 -213 (-3). He closed strong with a 33 on his final nine.<br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCarroll was cruising having made six birdies through the 14th hole and held a two-shot edge on Bradley before the tables turned. Wayward drives on 15 and 16 and a three putt on the 17th resulted in bogeys. One group ahead was the soon-to-be champion who played the last four holes in 1 under, topped off with a birdie on 18.<br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBradley is the son of Purdue golf coach and former UNF assistant Rob Bradley.<br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAnother UNF golfer Davis Lee tied for fourth with Bryce Lewis, a University of Tennessee sophomore, at 215 (-1). <br><br> \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the Mid-Amateur division, Garrett Jones of Madison, Wis. claimed the crown, defeating Chris Henderson of Jacksonville, Fla. on the first hole of a sudden-death playoff. The pair finished regulation with six-over par 222 totals.<br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nJones, a former Badger golfer and now volunteer assistant for the University of Wisconsin golf team, parred the extra hole to win the age 25+ competition. Jones and Henderson finished T29 in Championship play. Henderson will play for the amateur squad in next month’s Underwood Cup at Timuquana Country Club in Jacksonville.<br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTop finishers in the JAGA First Coast Amateur receive World Amateur Golf Ranking points for the second year in a row.<br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis year’s move to The Conservatory led to additional interest in the championship. The field was increased from 78 to 96 and was filled in 30 days. A waiting list grew to 36.<br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlayers from 22 states, five countries and 29 colleges participated. The College of Charleston topped the field with 10 current or committed players in the field, followed by Ohio State with six and UNF and Tennessee with five. Purdue was well represented with four players at Hammock Beach Resort.<br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn addition to Hammock Beach Resort, the tournament was supported by the Palm Coast and Flagler Beaches tourism group. They hosted Monday’s Awards Luncheon in addition to supporting the accommodation needs of players and families in the run up to the event.<br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n“A good tournament got even better this year,” said First Coast Amateur co-chairmen Joel Lamp and Jeff Adams. “We are grateful to Hammock Beach Resort, The Conservatory golf course and the Palm Coast and Flagler Beaches tourism group for welcoming JAGA and the First Coast Amateur. We couldn’t have had a better first-year experience and are confident the players and their guests share that sentiment.”",

    "teaser": "The 2020 PGA Show is underway in Orlando, and day 1 got off to a fast (but cold!) start at Orange County National",
    "articleText": "The 2020 PGA Show is underway in Orlando, and AmateurGolf.com is here to experience it all. Day 1 started early with Demo Day at Orange County National Golf Club, with golf companies big and small showing off their latest offerings.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe driving range at Orange County National is a giant 360-degree layout, and the various companies with all of their tents, banners, displays, clubs, and accessories were laid out in a big circle on the range's perimeter.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThere was a good vibe about the proceedings -- equipment folks ready to explain why their equipment is the most revolutionary; media taking videos and still shots, interviewing reps, and writing reports; patrons craning their necks for the next celebrity appearance or marveling at players' golf swings (good and bad).<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut there was one sensation that all, no matter what role they were playing, felt on day one: cold!<br><br>\r\n\r\nA cold front swept through the Orlando area as the PGA Show was set to begin, and a bone-chilling wind blew across the range at Orange County National all day. That not only brought out the beanies, sweaters, and jackets, but it wreaked havoc on several of the displays. It also prompted the question of whether it was better or worse to demo equipment into the wind (Honma), go downwind (Cobra), or battle a crosswind (Callaway).<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs with every PGA Show, there were lots of splashy new releases. Among the top products released were:<br><br><hr>\r\n\r\n<b>Titleist Vokey SM8 Wedges:</b> Titleist set up an interactive short-game practice demo with three stations, so that players could try a variety of pitching wedge, gap wedge, and lob wedge loft-and-bounce combinations. After tour pro Brad Faxon finished his clinic, players were ushered in four at a time to go through the progression.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-equipment-reviews/Wedges/25897/Titleist-Introduces-new-Vokey-Design-SM8-Wedges\">Related: Titleist Introduces new Vokey Design SM8 Wedges</a><br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Scotty Cameron Special Select Putters:</b> Eight new blade and mid-mallet setups were released, featuring sleeker putter head profiles with thinner and flatter toplines, refined neck configurations, soft tri-soles and performance balanced weighting.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-equipment-reviews/Putters/25898/Titleist-unveils-new-Scotty-Cameron-Special-Select-Putters\">Related: Titleist unveils new Scotty Cameron Special Select Putters</a><br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>PING G710 irons:</b> The sleek, dark finish of the new G710's was on full display, and was the first thing that caught one's eye when they looked into the demo bags at the PING exhibit. They call the finish \"Hydropearl Stealth\" and that was a pretty apt name for it.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-equipment-reviews/Irons/25902/PING-releases-G710-distance-iron-with-Arccos-Caddie-Smart-Grips\">PING releases G710 distance iron with Arccos Caddie Smart Grips</a><br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Callaway Chrome Soft and Chrome Soft X Golf Balls:</b> The newest iteration of each of these balls better serves the purpose of each: the Chrome Soft is for the player looking for distance throughout the bag, while the Chrome Soft X is for the player who wants maximum distance off the tee but maximum consistency through the green.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-equipment-reviews/Balls/25901/Just-released--the-Callaway-Chrome-Soft-and-Chrome-Soft-X\">Related: Just released: the Callaway Chrome Soft and Chrome Soft X</a><br><hr><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059686.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\nThere were also plenty of celebrities taking part in the proceedings. In addition to Faxon at Titleist, PING brought in Stan Utley for a putting demonstration. Peter Jacobsen, Bob Vokey and Chip Beck were all present. Then, just before one o'clock, a helicopter buzzed overhead before landing behind the Cobra exhibit, delivering Lexi Thompson and Greg Norman to the tee for their demonstration.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThere was something for every sense (even taste, if you were up for a free morning beer courtesy of Tour Edge). The prevailing sound was the clicking of balls being struck, overlaid with the hum of the wind, and interspersed with music coming from different directions. The choice of music said something about the each company who played it. There was classic rock at Honma, a folksy live duo (one of whom played a fiddle) at Tour Edge, and a live DJ booming out noise at Cobra.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe products ranged from the traditional to the cutting edge to the head-scratching. Do those camouflage shirts really have four sleeves? Will people really pay six thousand dollars for a three-wheeler to carry them and their clubs? From products promising to cure pains and ailments, to training aids requiring instruction manuals, to a golf game (Fling Golf) that really isn't golf at all, more like a cross between lacrosse, golf and -- since we're in Florida -- jai alai.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn all, Day 1 of the 2020 PGA Show was a whirlwind in more ways than one. The Show moves indoors for tomorrow (where the temperature will be pleasant and the winds calm), and will run through Friday.",

The two-stage coating process ensures durability and the darker finish creates the perception of a smaller, more compact head.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Alta Distanza Black 40 Graphite Shaft</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nThis shaft offers the lightest weight and max trajectory height available in a PING iron shaft. A more active tip in the 43-gram shaft delivers higher trajectories and best matches golfers with slower swing speeds.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Arccos Caddie Smart Grip & Arccos Caddie app</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Arccos Caddie Golf Pride 360 Tour Velvet Smart Grip is standard on every G710 iron in one of three sizes (Aqua -1/64&#8243;, White Std., Gold +1/32&#8243;). Each iron is custom built with an embedded sensor in the grip to automatically record and analyze every shot taken during a round when paired with the Arccos Caddie app.<br><br>\r\n\r\nGolfers receive a 90-day free trial of the app (then $99.99 annual subscription) and eight additional screw-in sensors at no charge after the purchase of six or more G710 irons. Fulfillment of the additional free sensors comes directly from PING and requires users to first download the Arccos Caddie app.",

It certainly woke everyone up and got the energy going.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059690.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\nThe doors opened shortly thereafter, and Titleist presented \"A Tribute to Partnership\", honoring the 2019 PGA Professional of the Year, Eric Eshelman of the Country Club of Birmingham (Ala.). In the amateur golf world, Eshelman and the CCOB host the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/3359/Birmingham-National-Invitational\">Birmingham National Invitational</a>, one of the nation's top mid-amateur events. But he is better known back home for the huge junior golf program he has fostered, and for his most well-known student, Dr. Condoleezza Rice.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe former Secretery of State and host Jim Nantz -- whose voice is as syrupy and golden in person as it is on the air -- joined Eshelman on the stage and it was a great and wide-ranging discussion.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFrom there it was onto the floor to become immersed in the swirling mass of products and promotion.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAll the big companies were present (except for TaylorMade, which famously skips the show), with grand and meticulously prepared sets and well-dressed reps ready to explain the fabulousness of their latest offerings.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059691.jpg\"\r\nalt=\"Scottie Cameron at the PGA Show\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><div style=\"text-align:center; font-size:14px;\">Scottie Cameron drew a crowd</div>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\nThe white coats at Titleist (Nantz got \"awarded\" one earlier) were there; Scotty Cameron was autographing Masters flags, putter covers, and anything else put in front of him; media were taking their live shots and filming their B-roll.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Golf Channel was filming live throughout the day, mixing in on-floor interviews, lessons with the pro, and talk show banter. Familiar faces from the network were seen all across the floor.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe two things that strike a PGA Show attendee are (1) the sheer number of people swarming about, and (2) the sheer number and variety of products being pushed, from the familiar and traditional to the cutting edge and even bizarre. Every facet of the game is touched, even if it is a real stretch to make that contact.<br><br>\r\n\r\nGolf has come from shepherds hitting stones with sticks to urethane covers, perimeter weighting, spin milled grooves, high-density tungsten weights, jet black finishes, and faces designed by artificial intelligence. Are we overthinking it just a little?<br><br>\r\n\r\nOf course not!<br><br>\r\n\r\nThere are areas dedicated to equipment, apparel, technology, fitness, instruction, golf facility solutions, travel, and every other facet of golf one could think of (and many one couldn't).<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhat would Old Tom Morris have thought about the Rope Drill Swing Trainer? Or \"surfing the earth\" with Golf Board? How about the RoboGolfPro (which looks like something out of a science fiction movie)? Golf has certainly come a long way, even if it seems to be going in a million directions at once.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThere is a lot to learn at the PGA Show, from how complex clubheads like the Callaway Mavrik are constructed to the origin of the \"Titleist\" script that has appeared on their golf balls since the beginning (it was from Helen Robinson, the office secretary of founder Phil Young; it was her beautiful penmanship that inspired Young to ask her to write \"Titleist\" on a sheet of paper, which is how the script appears today).<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25783/A-golf-ball-empire-started-with-a-single-missed-putt-in-1932\">A golf ball empire started with a single missed putt in 1932</a><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe least disorienting area of the show was probably the indoor mini-range at the far end of the equipment section. There was a long line of artificial turf hitting stations where players could sample every sort of brand and model; the net was only 50 yards or so away but it was easy to track ball flight, especially in the absence of the wind that blew all over yesterday's demo day.<br><br>\r\n\r\nGetting a club in hand seemed to temporarily restore a sense of normalcy, and recharged the batteries before another trip through the maze that is the PGA Show floor. AmateurGolf.com will take another deep dive into the show tomorrow, as the whirlwind continues through Friday.",

    "teaser": "Some of the more curious sights and other random observations from a walk across the floor of the PGA Show",
    "articleText": "The 2020 PGA Show rolled into day 3 at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, with another full day of programs, promotions, and organized chaos.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25903/2020-PGA-Show-LIVE-Update--Day-2\">2020 PGA Show LIVE Update: Day 2</a><br>\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25900/2020-PGA-Show-LIVE-Update--Day-1\">2020 PGA Show LIVE Update: Day 1</a><br><br>\r\n\r\nHere are some random observations after another day of walking the floor:<br><br>\r\n\r\n• The PGA Forum stage runs programs all day long, touching on a wide variety of subjects. Today there were panels discussing golf travel (with a chance to win a trip to Morocco); succeeding as a PGA Professional; junior golf; entrepreneurship; a PGA Professional town hall; college coaching and recruiting; caddying; and the state of the industry presented by the CEO's of the USGA, PGA of America, National Golf Course Owners Association, and Golf Course Superintendents Association.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059695.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><div style=\"text-align:center; font-size:14px;\">The junior golf town hall on the PGA Forum stage</div>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n• The putting greens that the equipment companies construct for the Show are interesting concoctions, slightly elevated and almost level artificial turf surfaces, with holes interspersed about. They are fun place to try out a wide selection of putters, even if it can be hard to hit a putt of more than 15 feet due to all of the legs to putt around or through.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOn one green I counted 36 people, in addition to the bags, putters, alignment aids, tracks and other devices. I attempted a 20-footer, and then watched as someone took my ball before I could get to the hole.<br><br>\r\n\r\n• Everything changes when you cross the line from equipment section to apparel. Suddenly the clientele is younger, better looking, and more stylish, and the female-to-male ratio goes way up. The range of colors expands greatly.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059694.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\n• I would estimate that about 35% of the models shown in the images on the various apparel exhibits look like they have ever played golf. I'm pretty sure I saw one using a pencil grip on her driver.<br><br>\r\n\r\n• The brand I Suck at Golf (whose name essentially guarantees that no tour pro will ever endorse it) had a display case with a line of vacuum cleaners, each held by a hand wearing a different colored glove. I don't have the marketing expertise to interpret the message there, but if it is simply to draw attention then it worked for me.<br><br>\r\n\r\n• The fashion show stage is hidden next to the racquet and paddle sports show at the far end of the floor. The runway models (who, again, have probably have not ever played golf) were seen being coached on their catwalk skills in preparation for the fashion show. If the PGA Tour ever had a fashion show, I think <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=466707677496625\" target=\"_blank\">Rory McIlroy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KLyYFl3yFs\" target=\"_blank\">Vijay Singh</a> would be the most natural runway walkers.<br><br>\r\n\r\n• It is in this same area where the winners of the Best New Product awards are displayed. My favorite new products: (1) Golf shoes by Lottusse, a shoe company based in Mallorca in Spain; known for its waterproofing technology. The shoes I saw were lightweight, waterproof, dark in color, very stylish. (2) The Tee Band, a Wonder Woman style wristband that turns you into a superhero on the course, ready to deploy your tees, divot tool and ball marker.<br><br>\r\n\r\n• I also noticed a significantly increased presence of CBD products: gummies, sprays, oils, creams, even dog treats.<br><br>\r\n\r\n• For those hoping to walk away with free gear from the PGA Show, the pickings are slim. It is easy to collect some pretty nice hats, as the companies essentially allow the hat wearer to advertise the product for them. Other than that, attendees with a sweet tooth can find something to sample (the logoed cookies at Peter Millar were a pleasant surprise.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059696.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><div style=\"text-align:center; font-size:14px;\">AGC correspondent Hannah Leiner<br>with Kyle Rector at Puma</div>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\nThese lighter moments are a welcome respite from some of the more serious business going on at the PGA Show, and AmateurGolf.com has had a good week of solidifying relationships, and building new ones. Ideas are flying around, pleasantries being exchanged, familiar faces greeted, and plans being made for the 2020 season and beyond.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, we will continue to bring you all of the latest equipment news and reviews, and everything else from the PGA Show as it wraps up on Friday.",

There was a very athletic, left-footed striker playing simulated footgolf as well.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe loudest microphone belonged to the golf fitness and wellness speakers who were booming out talks about getting fit and about the various training aids that might build fitter golfers.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059697.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><div style=\"text-align:center; font-size:14px;\">AGC founder Pete Wlodkowski<br>with Kyle Rector at Callaway</div>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\nWith more room to maneuver, there were more opportunities to get manufacturers on camera to talk about their brands.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAmateurGolf.com had extended conversations with FootJoy (footwear), FlightScope (portable launch monitors), and OBAN (golf shafts) -- look for those videos, plus all of our other video coverage from a busy week at the PGA Show, on the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/\" target=\"_blank\">AGC website</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/amateurgolf\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amateurgolfcom\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/amateurgolf/\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>.",

After both players hit the green, Kim had her chance to seal it with a long range putt for birdie, it missed, and left Bennett with her chance to keep the contest alive. Sadly for there 20 year old, her 8 footer slid by, and with it the match was Kim’s.\r\n\r\nKim was ecstatic after the victory.\r\n\r\n“Second time is a charm,” she grinned. ” I was pretty confident I could get it done today.”\r\n\r\n” I knew I could compete, Kelsey played good and I knew how good I had to play to beat her.”\r\n\r\nThe win is Kims’s first State Championship and she was thrilled to know her name joins a list of many of Australia’s finest female players.\r\n\r\n” I know Karrie has won this event and she is a hero of mine, so it is exciting to see my name engraved on a trophy with hers.",

    "title": "FootJoy wants to know: Are you wearing the right size golf glove?",
    "teaser": "A fitting with FootJoy's resident glove whisperer, Maria Bonzagni, opened my eyes to the importance of a snug fit",
    "articleText": "When FootJoy’s Senior Director of Golf Gloves, Maria Bonzagni, offered to put me through a glove fitting, I didn't think I would have much to learn. After all, I’ve been wearing the same size golf glove all my life and haven't given it a second thought in years.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOh, that's easy. \"I'm a medium,\" I told her nonchalantly. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThen, when I put my hand up at her request, I saw Maria crack a big smile. It was pretty obvious this \"glove whisperer\" knew something that I didn't. <br><br>\r\n\r\n“It’s kind of a magic trick,” she joked. “I can look at someone’s hand and tell them their glove size 95% of the time.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs she handed me a beautiful FootJoy StaSof glove to try on, Bonzagni asked me not to look at the size, to avoid being biased. If you haven’t guessed the answer by now, I’ll tell you. The glove felt great, but it wasn’t a medium, it was a “cadet” medium. It turns out I have slightly shorter fingers and that the cadet size makes for a better all-around fit.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059720.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\n“Most golfers wear a glove that’s too big for them,” explained Bonzagni. “That results in the glove wearing out more quickly, and more importantly forces you to grip the club too hard.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nKnowing full well the poor shots that can be the result of gripping the club too hard, I nodded in agreement and made a mental note of my new glove size. And I left the fitting thinking it’s pretty cool that a glove company would want to educate people on something that would result in them buying gloves less frequently.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd I soon realized there is more to the story. By offering new products for different player types, and the four seasons, FootJoy is growing the size of the glove market while providing players a reason to own different gloves, for different seasons.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TkXaHC3atk0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>\r\n\r\nI’ve long carried a pair of FootJoy “RainGrip” wet weather gloves. I swear by them. They never leave my bag, except to dry out after a rainy day. FootJoy’s latest white/grey color option is a nice alternative to the black ones I use. (The solid black is still available though.) The great thing about RainGrip gloves is that not only do they come in a pair, they actually are meant to be wet. So when you take them out you simply rub a little rain water on them and you’re good to go. I usually find a clean piece of wet fairway and rub my hands lightly over it. At $25 a pair, FootJoy RainGrip gloves are an essential piece of equipment for anyone who plays in the rain.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut even with a couple of leather gloves and a pair of RainGrip gloves in my bag, it turns out I’m still missing out on some of the other options that can make golf more enjoyable in extreme weather, either hot/humid or cold. <br><br>\r\n\r\nFor summer heat waves or island vacations, FootJoy now has a glove aptly named the “Tropicool” which is designed to be more tacky when your hands perspire — perfect for those hat, muggy conditions — or any day if you’re prone to hand perspiration. At just $16 each, Tropicool make a smart choice even for once-in-a-while use.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd then there’s my favorite new glove — and it also comes in a pair — the StaSof Winter. <br><br>\r\n\r\nHere you have a supple white CabrettaSof leather n the front combined with a soft and warm grey fleece material on the back that looks and feels amazing. And which I could immediately tell will keep my hands warm next time I have either a chilly 7:00am tee time. <br><br>\r\n\r\nWith FootJoy's glove offerings for all four seasons added to my arsenal, I’m going to be prepared. Old Tom Morris would approve.",

    "title": "The 10 most interesting products at the 2020 PGA Merchandise Show",
    "teaser": "The quest to find ways to improve, or just have more fun in this increasingly overcomplicated game, is never ending",
    "articleText": "The 2020 PGA Merchandise Show swept into Orlando last week, showcasing a voluminous range of brands and products, from the giants of the industry down to the one-man inventor types.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSince the days of featheries and wooden clubs, golf has been a game that, perhaps more than any other, is about a never-ending search for improvement. For the golfers, it is: how can I improve my swing, my stroke, my game? For merchandisers, it is: how can we make golfers swing better, hit it farther, hit it closer, roll it truer, shoot lower scores, and have more fun?<br><br>\r\n\r\nThat spirit was alive and well in Orlando, even if some of the products on display strained the imagination. Walking around the show floor, two things became evident: (1) there is not a single facet of the game that someone isn't trying to improve with the most creative ideas possible, and (2) some people are really starting to overthink this game!<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHere are the 10 most interesting products we saw at the 2020 PGA Show -- the ones that most inspired us, confused us, and amused us:<br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059706.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<b>The Feedback Putter Grip: </b>This is an all-metal putting grip mounted by screws onto the putter shaft. Nothing could be less comfortable to putt with, right? Exactly! The theory behind the grip is that the vibration from the strike of the ball will go from putter head to shaft to grip and right into the player's hands, providing instant feedback when compared to the more conventional foam and rubber grips.<br><br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059707.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<b>Hackmotion Wrist Sensor: </b>The Feedback Putter Grip is all about feel, but here is the polar opposite approach: data and analytics. This device measures the angles and movement of the wrists in the full swing, short game shots and putting. Wrist motion has been linked to control of the clubface, and teachers can use this wrist sensor to collect data, measure progress and compare results with PGA Tour pros.<br><br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059710.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<b>The Tee Band: </b>This a Wonder Woman style wristband turns you into a superhero on the course, ready to deploy your tees, divot tool and ball marker. No more digging into dirt-stained pockets, and no more tees in shoelaces or ponytails. An elastic strap holds the tees and divot tool, while a sewn-in magnet holds the ball marker. Marketed more to women golfers who are more likely than men to go pocketless on the course (and more likely to look like Wonder Woman). A similar product, the Shu Caddy, that clips onto your shoe laces, also debuted this year.<br><br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059711.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<b>Lottusse Golf Shoes: </b>Lottusse is a shoe company founded in Mallorca in Spain and dates back to 1877. They are entering the golf market with a line of shoes that showcases what they are known for: high-quality leather with a unique waterproofing technology. In fact, they claim that their golf shoes have complete impermeability. The shoes on display at the PGA Show were stylish and surprisingly lightweight.<br><br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059712.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<b>Golphers Ace Everyday Carry: </b>This line of EDC (everyday carry) pocket knives was designed by Eric Ochs, a Pacific Northwest professional custom knife maker. For golfers, there is a titanium divot tool and a stainless steel ball marker, as well as a built-in bottle opener. Perfect for the golfer who stiffs a 7-iron and celebrates by popping open a brew and skinning a rabbit before sinking his birdie putt.<br><br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059713.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<b>The Delta Putt: </b>This is a training aid for putting that involves striking a triangular \"puck\" down a track toward a target. Each side of the triangle has a different-sized bump corresponding to difficulty level (amateur, pro and tour), and the only way to putt the puck straight down the track is if both the stroke path and putter face are square at impact. The feedback is instantaneous and allows you to make adjustments based upon it. Of course there is way more to making putts than just a square face, but it's an interesting aid and fun to try.<br><br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059714.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<b>ECHO Robotics RP-1200 Range Picker: </b>This is the \"Roomba of the Range\", an autonomous vehicle that picks up range balls (up to 300 at a time) and delivers them to a designated drop-off area. It is purported to work rain or shine, day or night, and it can work in tandem with another autonomous model that mows the grass. It is yet another brilliant use of technology to perform an otherwise mundane task, even if it robs golfers of one of the true pleasures of beating balls: taking aim at the guy in the range cart.<br><br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059715.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<b>The Greenie String: </b>This is a pretty simple product that allows players to measure how far away a ball is from the hole. There is 60 feet of line with a clasp on the end that hooks around the flagstick, and the container is the size of a poker chip and can be used as a ball marker. Use it in case of a dispute in who might be away in a match, or who is closest to hole if playing greenies. For those who don't want to eyeball it, lay down the flagstick, or elaborately pace heel-to-toe on the line of the putt.<br><br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059716.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<b>ImpactLiner: </b>This is a training aid that fits over the butt end of the grip, and shoots a laser light that shows where the butt end of the club is pointing throughout the swing. Some teachers posit that the laser light should point at the ball at various points of the swing (even if many great touring pros would fail the test), and this would provide feedback toward that goal. At the PGA Show, there was a banner proudly declaring that this product is \"Made in France\" -- not sure how persuasive a marketing tactic that is, any more than a \"Made in the USA\" cricket bat would be.<br><br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059717.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<b>Super Distance Rope: </b>Another international entry, this one comes from Korea where the game continues to explode in popularity. The promise is up to 20-30 meters of increased distance for those golfers who have an \"armsy\" swing. If the swing has proper sequencing, the guide ball at the end of the rope will hit a target zone at the top of the swing (meaning it will wrap around the shoulder in a certain way), make a sound in the impact zone as the rope straightens, and hit a target zone in the follow-through. There is cute lost-in-transition verbiage such as it helping golfers use the \"leggings\" more in the swing. I don't know if it works or not but I couldn't help but root for this small company, buried deep on the showroom floor, trying to break through and pursuing their dream so far from home.",

    "articleText": "The first nine national qualifying sites have been announced for the King's Cup, the international team matches for competitive and handicap amateurs between the United States and Ireland.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe King's Cup, named in honor of golf's ultimate ambassador Arnold Palmer, is entering its 6th year and allows two-man amateur teams the chance to represent their country.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThere are two divisions – the Open Division and Senior Division. The Open Division is open to all ages. The Senior Division is for teams where both players are 55 years of age and above.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe road to the King's Cup is laid out in three stages:<br><br>\r\n\r\n(1) <b>National Qualifying</b> held at sites around the country for two-man amateur teams. Scoring at a national qualifier is 18 holes of best-ball NET, with each teammate receiving 85% of their course handicap. The low 30% of the field and ties will qualify for the USGC National Championship.<br><br>\r\n\r\n(2) <b><a \r\nhref=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-\r\ntournaments/8928/USGC-\r\nKing-s-Cup-National-Championship\">The U.S. Golf Challenge (USGC) National Championship</a></b> will be held September 10-12, 2020 at The Legends Golf Complex in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Two-man teams will compete on three different courses in three different formats, and the successful qualifiers will represent Team USA in the International King's Cup. Round 1 is a best-ball, round 2 is alternate shot, and round 3 is aggregate stroke play. There are four flights in each Division determined by Team Index: Championship flight = 4.9 and under, A-flight = 5.0 to 9.9, B-flight = 10.0 to 14.9, C-flight = 15.0 and above.<br><br>\r\n\r\n(3) <b><a \r\nhref=\"http://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-\r\ntournaments/8927/International-King-s-\r\nCup\">The International King's Cup</a></b> will be held in the spring of 2021 at Glasson Golf Club, one of the most challenging and scenic golf courses in Ireland. The divisions and flights will be the same as in the USGC National Championship.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe format for the International King's Cup is modified team match play. Each team in each flights plays every hole in that day’s format. Day 1 is a best-ball format, Day 2 is modified alternate shot, Day 3 is singles matches. Each hole is worth 2 points. Winning a hole is worth 2 points, a tie is worth 1 point and a loss of a hole is worth 0 points.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAt the end of each match, each flight totals their points. When all the flights have finished their matches the total points from each flight are added together to form an overall total for the team that day. The team with the most overall total points after the 3 days of competition wins the International King’s Cup. In the event of a tie, the team currently holding the Cup retains the Cup.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTo see what the King's Cup is all about, watch the video below:<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fusgolfchallenge%2Fvideos%2F2776974205719111%2F&show_text=0&width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allowFullScreen=\"true\"></iframe></div><br>\r\n\r\nIn 2019, Team USA won the King's Cup for the first time at the Bay Hill Club and Lodge in Florida. Last year's qualifiers have determined the team for 2020, and Team USA will attempt to retain the Cup at Castlerock Golf Club in Northern Ireland.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis year's road to the King's Cup starts with the announcement of the first nine national qualifying sites.

While for Barbieri, it marks his first World Ranking event title after a year of near misses on the international stage.\r\n\r\nKim carded rounds of 66, 70, 71, 70 and was at her impressive best in a see saw battle which saw the lead change a number of times.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nA shot down with three to play she drew on all her experience to triumph by two over the courageous Japanese challenger Tsubasa Kajitani.\r\n\r\nThe top three were rounded out by Fiona Xu from Akarana Golf Club in New Zealand. Xu shot two-under-par 70 including four birdies.\r\n\r\nShuri Sakumi from the Japanese Golf Association improved her position by six on the ladder with an impressive hole in one on the 8th.\r\n\r\nFor Barbieri, the maiden crown is a huge weight lifted from his shoulders after a couple of near misses in 2019 at the Australian and NSW Amateur Championships.\r\n\r\nBarbieri held onto the lead during the final day with five-under-par 66, finishing the tournament at 16-under-par.\r\n\r\nBarbieri managed to keep at bay the young 17 year old Englishmen Ben Schmidt who has been impressive over the past four days off the back of his win at the NSW Amateur Championships last week. Today Schmidt finished at two-under-par for a score of 69 which included an eagle on the 7th.\r\n\r\nAndre Lautee of Kingston Health Golf Club and Ren Yonezawa from the Japanese Golf Association finished equal third. Lautee improved his position by eight in the final day, finishing three-under-par 68 today and 10-under-par overall. Yonezawa finished on par today and also 10-under-par overall.\r\n\r\nFollowing Japanese golfer Taichei Kimura’s new course record yesterday, Louis Dobbelaar went one better with a score of 62 which included nine birdies which rocketed him 25 places up the ladder to finish 8th.\r\n\r\n<i>Information from Avondale Golf Club was used in this report.</i>",

    "teaser": "University of Georgia golfer Davis Thompson (St. Simons Island) fires 68 to grab the lead with one round to play",
    "articleText": "Davis Thompson bogeyed the fourth hole for the second-straight day but was his only mistake today, as he matched the low round of the tournament (68) and took command of the Jones Cup with one round to play.\r\n\r\nThompson, who lives in St. Simons Island (next to Sea Island) is a junior at University of Georgia. Last year, he finished runner here at Ocean Forest to Akshay Bhatia.\r\n\r\n\"I didn’t make a lot of mistakes today,\" said Thompson. \r\n\r\n\"I got a bad break on No. 4, when I hit in to the pine straw and had three pine cones around my ball, which led to my only bogey of the day. \"but I chipped in on 12 which was huge because I was in an awkward spot and could have easily made bogey but ended up with a birdie.\"\r\n\r\nThompson, said the course was in phenomenal shape, with greens he said were rolling at perfect \"putt-making speed.\"\r\n\r\n\"It’s nice to stay at home and sleep in your own bed for a big amateur event,\" he added.\r\n\r\nAt 6-under 138 through 36 holes, Thompson is trailed by Westpoint, MS high school junior Cohen Trolio (who matched Thompson's 68 today to get to 4-under).\r\n\r\nLast summer, Trolio had the amateur golf world buzzing when he made it to the semi-finals of the U.S. Amateur at Pinehurst, despite being outdriven by 50 yards by some of his opponents. His father V.J. is the teaching professional at Old Waverly Country Club. \r\n\r\nIt's certainly not unheard of for young players to excel at the Jones Cup -- some of them have experienced the course at the Jones Cup Junior (played in December). Last year's champion Akshay Bhatia was a teenager when he brought home the title -- he has since turned professional. (Alas, Bhatia shot 4-over to miss the cut this weekend in Saudi Arabia.)\r\n\r\nAnother shot back at 3-under is University of Illinois golfer David Perkins. Another five players are tied at 2-under 142 -- any of them could post a low number to make a final round charge. First round leader Chris Gotterup got to 6-under after birdies on two of the first three holes, but he found the bogey train after that, and soared to a 77 to drop down to T16. \r\n\r\nFIRST ROUND RECAP\r\n\r\nby Shawn Allen\r\n\r\nIt's official, another season of amateur golf is underway.\r\n\r\nThe biggest event on the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/TheMajorsOfAmateurGolf\">Majors of Amateur Golf</a> spring calendar teed off at Ocean Forest Golf Club in Sea Island, Georgia.\r\n\r\nChris Gotterup, a Junior on the Rutgers University Golf Team, opened the Jones Cup today with a 4-under 68 and holds a one shot lead. He is trailed by Julien Sale, a Senior at Arkansas State, with two other golfers tied for third at 2-under. Ocean Forest isn't known for giving up low rounds, and today was no different.\r\n\r\nGotterup divided his score with a balanced 34-34 on each nine, carding three birdies and one bogey per side. Notably, three of the Little Silver, NJ, native’s birdies came on three of the most difficult holes on the course, including the toughest, a 618 yard par-5.\r\n\r\nThis level of play is not unexpected for Gotterup, after a successful Fall NCAA season. He was the highest ranked golfer in the Big Ten Conference and is ranked 33rd in the NCAA with an adjusted scoring average of 70.11 that included a victory at the Fighting Irish Classic -- where he posted 14-under over three rounds.\r\n\r\nGotterup’s showing is significant as he is one of only nine other golfers under par in a stacked field that includes four players inside the WAGR Top 20- John Pak (6), Davis Thompson (9), John Augenstein (12), and Joseph Pagdin (16).\r\n\r\nIn only two more rounds, a new player will add his name to a list that includes some of the world's top ranked pros.",

    "teaser": "Flightscope's Mevo+ launch monitor delivers 16 accurate data points and comes loaded with 17 ranges and 5 courses, all for $1999",
    "articleText": "We would all love to own a $10-20,000 launch monitor like the game's top teachers and Tour players. Alas, that's not in the cards for most amateur players. But with the advent of \"personal launch monitors\" in the last year or so, we at AmateurGolf.com have taken a keen interest. After all, cell phones of today take better pictures and video than the digital cameras of a few years ago. So shouldn't launch monitors be packing more punch into a smaller and cheaper package?<br><br>\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year, we tested several personal launch monitors in the $300-500 range and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-equipment-reviews/Accessories/25865/Affordable-Launch-Monitors--Flightscope-Mevo-more-than-impresses\">declared the Flightscope Mevo to be the best of the bunch</a>. But the gap in accuracy and features between the Mevo and its big brother the X3 is considerable. We love the value of the Mevo, and it has been hugely successful at retail.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSo successful, in fact, that it proved the market exists for something heftier. Enter the Mevo+.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TVKgafoWnmA\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>\r\n\r\nAt $1999, golfers are going to demand much more from Mevo+ than the Mevo. And wow, does it ever deliver. Mevo+ provides twice as many data points as Mevo (16) including key information like total distance, roll distance, spin data, and horizontal launch angle. In short, you've got a more complete picture of what's happening to every shot you hit. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059814.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\nNow comes the kicker. Mevo+ doubles as a game simulator -- it comes loaded E6 simulation software, which provides the ability to practice on 17 types of driving ranges, virtually play five different golf courses and various mini-games. You can play on an iPad or phone; with a projector or large monitor the experience turns into virtual golf (including putting and chipping).<br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059816.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\nI tried Mevo+ in a hitting bay - the course setup was Carlsbad's Aviara (one of the 5 preloaded courses). Since I'm very familiar with Aviara, I put it to the test on the par-3 3rd hole. The yardage, view of the hole, and shot data were extremely accurate and realistic.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFlightscope's founder, Henri Johnson, has been a pioneer in the business of tracking fast moving \"stuff\" since 1989 when his proprietary technology was originally used to track projectiles for the defense industry. Since then, his company has achieved many \"firsts\" in radar tracking in cricket, tennis, and golf.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"The Mevo+ is a game-changer for serious golfers who want to create efficient and enjoyable practice sessions,\" said Johnson. \"It provides incredibly useful performance information and next level entertainment features.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nWe will have a Mevo+ in our hands soon, and when we take it out we'll report on it in depth, as we did earlier for the Mevo. Stay tuned. And if you're interested in purchasing a Mevo or Mevo+ please let us know and we'll get you set up.",

It's a unique look to be sure, and the company says that the design \"increases the milled area by 95%\" which maximizes the zone where maximum ball speed can be achieved. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Speedzone is available in two models - Speedzone and Speedzone Xtreme. Both come in 460cc size, with the Speedzone shape more oriented towards control and workability (recommended for players in the 0-10 handicap range) and the Xtreme aimed at maximizing forgiveness.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g2iobGl7Wq0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br><br>\r\n\r\nAs such, the Speedzone comes in lofts typically used by better players who don't need as much help with launch - 9 and 10.5 degrees. The Speedzone Xtreme adds a 12 degree loft to the mix. The Speedzone comes with adjustable weights positioned in the front and back to tweak launch; the Xtreme has a weight port in the back only.'<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Infinity face, both models feature a new titanium T-Bar Speed Chassis. By using this reinforced structure, Cobra's designers were able to reduce the amount titanium used, allowing them to position weight is strategically around the perimeter so mishits fly longer and straighter.<br><br>\r\n\r\nPulling the whole thing together, a 360 carbon wrap crown covers 50% of the club body, adding stiffness to the chassis while saving an additional 25 grams of discretionary weight.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs with their previous models, Speedzone have a unique Speedback underneath; 69 grams of mass is positioned as low as possible to create the most efficient transfer of energy to the ball for high launch with low spin.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>ARCCOS CADDIE</b><br>\r\nBoth Speedzone models come with an Arccos embedded grip sensor that pairs with the Arccos Caddie app on your mobile device. You'll get access to Arccos' rich library of user data, so you can see trends from the millions of shots that Arccos has collected data on since their inception about 10 years ago.

    "teaser": "After losing in a playoff last year, Davis Thompson leaves no doubt with a record-setting performace at Ocean Forest GC",
    "articleText": "By Shawn Allen\r\n\r\nOn a bluebird day in Sea Island, Ga., the color of the day was red. Not just Davis Thompson’s red University of Georgia golf shoes, but his red numbers -- a tournament-record 7-under 65 and a 13-under 203 total.\r\n\r\nThompson, a junior at the University of Georgia, shattered the tournament scoring record by three shots. The record was originally set by Luke List and Gary Woodland in 2007, when List bested the future U.S. Open champion in a playoff.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThompson himself lost a playoff last year, falling to junior phenom Akshay Bhatia in a rain-shortened contest.\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/23458/Bhatia-wins-Jones-Cup-in-playoff-after-final-round-washed-out\">Bhatia wins Jones Cup in playoff after final round washed out</a>\r\n\r\nNo playoff was needed this year. After an opening round of 70, he fired a 4-under 68 to take the second-round lead. Then, he turned it on.\r\n\r\n\"I birdied the first, and just kept trying to hit quality iron shots,\" said Thompson. They were so quality they precipitated an avalanche of birdies. Starting on the seventh hole, Thompson stuffed it to four feet, making the birdie putt. He did the same on the next four holes, pulling away from the field. He tacked on one more birdie at the 13th for a total of seven on the day against no bogeys.\r\n\r\nSaid Thompson of his mindset: \"They can’t catch me if I birdie every hole.\" He was right.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the field struggled with the 15mph winds today, with Thompson's closest pursuer David Perkins finishing nine shots behind. The next low round was 69 from the third and fourth place finishers, Jackson Suber and Austin Hitt.\r\n\r\nThompson's 65 tied the tournament record set by Woodland and Colt Knost in 2007.\r\n\r\nThompson attributes his ability to score in the wind to the way he can flight the ball. \"I can hit it low or high depending on what I need. So I felt comfortable.\"\r\n\r\nBy the 13th hole, he had extended his lead to seven shots. \"I knew it was my tournament to lose.\" He admits he can get nervous, but he says, \"I try not to think. I pick my target and my line, then I hit it.\"\r\n\r\nIronically, he didn’t have a great practice round, and was working on his swing. \"To be honest, in the practice round, I kind of hit it all over.\" Thompson favors a draw, but he was pushing too far right off the face, \"so I was trying to get my arms and hips to go down the line together.\"\r\n\r\nClearly they did. Now Thompson will set his eyes on his NCAA season.\r\n\r\nThompson moved to No. 3 in the Golfweek/AmateurGolf.com World Amateur Ranking (and will move up from his No. 9 WAGR ranking), but this is his last individual tournament for a while. He will rejoin the 19th ranked Bulldogs for the Spring season. He doesn’t approach the two types of tournaments differently, but he does distinguish a difference in motivation. \"When I’m out there [with his team], I represent my teammates, my coaches, and my school. So I grind over every shot because every shot counts.\" \r\n\r\nBut taking stock on winning the Jones Cup, and turning his eyes slightly to the future, Thompson admits, \"I beat a lot of good golfers out there today. It means a lot to see my hard work pay off. I don’t know what the future holes, but I hope I can compete with the likes of Luke List and Justin Thomas,\" just two of the PGA stars on the Jones Cup past champions list.",

    "articleText": "One couldn’t have scripted a better day for players during the final round of the Sea Pines Junior Heritage competed on the famous South Carolina PGA TOUR stop, Harbour Town Golf Links. Welcomed with a morning chill, the sun helped the temperature rise, creating a golfer’s dream playing conditions. Both divisions would crown champions that came from behind to capture the title. However, it was an interesting twist on how each would take the championship.\r\n\r\nWith an even par back nine finish, Natasha Kiel (New Hope, PA) would head to the clubhouse and wait patiently in hopes of staying inside the top three. Little did she know she would soon be hoisting the winner’s trophy after an unfortunate turn of events for first round leader Savannah Hylton (Hilton Head Island). Hylton would make the walk to the 18th tee after a bogey on the 17th hole, focusing on a good tee shot and approach shot to the small green. After a good drive down the right side of the fairway, Hylton would hit her approach long and right of the green. From there, five shots later she carded a triple bogey. Kiel was following the updates through live scoring and expressed her shock of how the day unfolded. “My focus was to stay patient today and give myself an opportunity. This win gives me a lot of confidence, being my first major win. Knowing I can win, and especially post a good score to come from behind to win, is even more thrilling.” Kiel would post a 4-over par 75 in her final round to edge playing competitors Sophia Burnett (Bluffton, SC) and Hyojoon Jang (Bluffton, SC) by one shot.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nA similar scenario would take place in the boys division, but for the second year in a row – a playoff would decide the champion. Jackson Van Paris (Pinehurst, NC) started the day two shots back. However, after the front nine he would find himself tied for the lead. First round leader, Luke Sample (New York, NY) and Van Paris would go back and forth throughout the back nine, but it would be Van Paris who would take the lead going into the 18th hole. Hitting his approach shot to 10 feet, Van Paris 3-putted to fall back into a tie with Sample who still had the 18th to play. Sample would get up and down for par to force the playoff. Van Paris would only need one hole and one putt to secure the win over Sample, capturing his first win of the year. Van Paris expressed how great this win was for him and his confidence saying, “It’s a treat to play Harbour Town during this event and even better to shoot under-par. The course was in great condition and knowing I can come from behind to get the win gives me a good boost heading into the 2020 season.”\r\n\r\nRounding out the top three include Jerry Bruns (Beaufort, SC) who had an hole-in-one on hole seven in the final round, Max Green (Hilton Head Island, SC), Caleb Surratt (Indian Trail, NC) and Lance Simpson (Knoxville, TN).",

    "teaser": "Ryan van Velzen does a Tin Cup routine in the wind, but somehow still leads the African Amateur Stroke Play",
    "articleText": "The Africa Amateur Stroke Play Championship, being played at Leopard Creek Country Club, was a one-man show early into the third round.\r\n\r\nThen, the player of the tournament up to that point, Ryan van Velzen stumbled with a sextuple-bogey six on the seventh and the pressure was on.\r\n\r\nOn a tough day – tight pin positions, tees set back and a swirling, gusting wind up to 30 km per hour making club selection something of a lottery – Casey Jarvis and Samuel Simpson made experience and skills count with a pair of two-under-par 70s.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nVan Velzen slumped to 11-over 83, but such was his dominance in the opening two rounds that he still shared the 54-hole lead in the individual 72-hole tournament with Martin Vorster at three-under-par.\r\n\r\nThe pair holds a two-stroke edge over reigning Amateur Champion James Sugrue of Ireland, who endured woes of his own in the third round with a triple-bogey six on the 16th setting back his charge for the lead.\r\n\r\nThe shot of the day came from Ireland's Caolan Rafferty, whose one-under 71 included an unlikely hole-in-one at the par three 12th.\r\n\r\nRafferty’s second ace of his career in tournament play came from a pitching wedge from 145 yards.\r\n\r\n“I got the yardage, picked a club, and tried to hit a shot,” he said. “It was one of those funny ones. I didn’t really catch it and turned away in a bit of disgust. As I was turning back, I heard my playing partner telling it to go in, and I was like, ‘Sorry, that can’t be right!’ And as I turned round, it just disappeared!”\r\n\r\nIt was a bright spot in his round and helped him to one of just seven under-par totals on the day. He made the ace, two birdies, a bogey and a double-bogey for a scorecard that looked relatively clean compared to some.\r\n\r\nVan Velzen was cruising along at level par after the sixth and then simply imploded. “I was playing nicely up until then,” he said. “I tried to go for the flag, and just came out of it and blocked it right in the water. I dropped one and goofed it in the water again; dropped another and hit it in the water again; knocked it on and two-putted.\r\n\r\n“That just rattled me for the rest of the round. I didn’t really know what was going to come when I hit it. It was like a lucky packet,” he laughed.\r\n\r\nVoster also found conditions tough, but he kept himself in the game as he made three birdies in eight holes coming home to offset the three bogeys and two doubles. “It was a grind today,” he said. “I actually hit the ball pretty well, but some shots just didn’t go my way and I ended up making doubles. In the conditions, I’m happy with the way I actually played.”\r\n\r\nLike many of the overseas players, Sugrue found conditions made playing well difficult.\r\n\r\n“It was also extremely warm,” he remarked after his round of six-over 78. “The course was playing very tough and there were some very cheeky pin positions. Probably not as tough as my score suggests, because I didn’t play great. Birdies were hard to come by, and I only made one today compared to about eight yesterday.”\r\n\r\nJarvis is one stroke behind Sugrue in fourth going into the final round, and Simpson shared fifth with Great Britain’s Olly Huggins who carded a level-par 72, Rafferty and Duminy.\r\n\r\n<i>DAY TWO REPORT</i>\r\n\r\nBenoni junior Ryan van Velzen finished a yawning seven shots ahead of reigning Amateur champion James Sugrue from Ireland and compatriot Martin Vorster at the 36-hole mark of the African Amateur Stroke Play Championship.\r\n\r\nThe 18-year-old eagled the 18th at Leopard Creek for a second day in a row to post a six-under-par 66 on Tuesday that kept him in the top spot at 14-under 130.\r\n\r\nTeeing off on the first in the second round, he cruised his way to five-under without a dropped shot in sight up to the 15th hole. He made his only bogey of the day on the challenging par-three 16th, and more than redeemed himself with that eagle which exemplified his approach to playing the course which can seem intimidating.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“I’m not really used to shooting these kinds of scores,” he said. “I can do it in social rounds, but not too often in tournaments. But I’m just not making mistakes at the moment and I’m really happy with the way I’m playing.”\r\n\r\nHis seven-stroke lead at the halfway mark was assisted by two of the players who looked as if they could stay in touch with him.\r\n\r\nMallow’s Sugrue got his second round to seven-under through 16 holes and 10-under for the tournament. Then he made a triple-bogey seven on the eighth and signed off with a 68 for a share of second at seven-under.\r\n\r\n“I played very, very well for 17 holes,” he said. “Even when I made the triple, I thought I hit it a good way down there. It just crept into the bunker. I thought I hit an okay approach and it rolled into the bunker. I won’t talk about the rest,” he added of the times the ball rolled off the front of the green before he could hole it.”\r\n\r\nThe other player who could have been closer was countryman Christo Lamprecht, who made double-bogey on 16 before coming home on one-under 71 for the round and six-under for the tournament.\r\n\r\nHe was in fourth place on his own after his round.\r\n\r\n“I played pretty nicely today,” said the Southern Cape golfer. “Yesterday was just better scoring, but I felt like I managed to play really good golf. I was three-under with three holes to go and hit just one bad shot – the first really bad shot of the week – and I got punished for it.”\r\n\r\nThe man who did play himself into a share of second was Toyota Junior Golf World Cup captain Martin Vorster.\r\n\r\nThe GolfRSA National Squad member carded the second-best round of the day behind Van Velzen with his five-under 67. He went bogey-free to the turn at 18, and made four more on his way home.\r\n\r\nThere were bogeys on three and seven which left him further back from the lead than he would have liked. “I played really solid from tee to green,” said Voster. “The putter was a bit cold in the beginning, but it got hot towards the end. I’m going to have to go a bit lower. I like chasing and knowing that I need birdies to catch up.”\r\n\r\nHe will have it all to do, because Van Velzen is going to take the same approach. “I’m just going to keep doing what I’m doing and shoot another low one tomorrow,” he said.\r\n\r\n<i>DAY ONE REPORT</i>\r\n\r\nEkurhuleni junior Ryan van Velzen started the Africa Amateur Stroke Play Championship on Monday like a house on fire as he carded a superlative eight-under-par 64 around Leopard Creek Country Club, giving him a three-stroke edge over his nearest competitor.\r\n\r\nStarting on the 10th, Van Velzen birdied his first two holes, made two more on the 13th and 14th, before rounding out a dream opening nine with an eagle on the 18th with its notorious island green, which has seen many a dream round doused in the water.\r\n\r\n“The eagle was quite cool, because my playing partner hit it to a foot, and I boxed a 20-footer for eagle straight after him,” he said. “It’s quite a short par-five, but you have to hit it in the fairway, or else you can’t go for it. I was lucky enough to hit in the fairway.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAlthough he bogeyed his next hole, the 18-year-old Benoni Country Club member came back immediately with a birdie on the second before two more on six and eight saw him home three shots clear of fellow GolfRSA National Squad member Christo Lamprecht.\r\n\r\nSweden’s Algot Kleen – Van Velzen’s playing partner who hit it to within a foot on 18 – also eagled the par five on his way to five-under-par 67 and second place after the first day’s play.\r\n\r\nIreland’s James Sugrue and South Africa’s Jordan Duminy shared third place with a pair of 69s.\r\n\r\nA group of five players were in fifth at two under: Gustav Andersson of Sweden, South Africa’s Martin Vorster and the English duo of Robin Williams and Haider Hussain.\r\n\r\n“I’m really happy with my round,” said Van Velzen. “I hit it really well all day and I putted well. I made lots of putts, especially in the beginning of the round. The key to this course is keeping it on the short stuff. You can’t really spin it out of the rough, but if you’re in the fairway you can go at some flags.”\r\n\r\nLamprecht – fourth in 2017 and the runner-up in 2018 – also had just a single bogey on his card for his 67, which came on the short par-four fourth. Three birdies came on the back nine after he also started on the 10th, and three more on two, six and eight completed his scoring.\r\n\r\nKleen’s round was more of a struggle, with three bogeys, an eagle and five birdies dotting his card.\r\n\r\nDuminy got it to four-under after starting with three bogeys in his first five holes, but the 2019 Nomads SA Boys U-17 champion quickly regained those lost strokes with three birdies in the four remaining holes to turn level par. He made four more in the next six holes before giving one of the gains back with a bogey on the tough par-three seventh.\r\n\r\n“I knew I had two par-fives ahead of me after that start,” said the 17-year-old Louis Oosthuizen Junior Golf Academy member.\r\n\r\n“I knew if I could birdie those and just one more, I could start the second nine level. If I could have a good back nine, I could see what happens. It got going on the 15th when I hit a good approach with a three-wood to 40 feet and two-putted, and it got going from there.”\r\n\r\nFor the leader, it’s about riding his momentum. “I didn’t play too well in the practice round but I found something out there today so I hope I can keep it going tomorrow,” said Van Velzen.",

    "title": "TaylorMade SIM Driver: The AmateurGolf.com Review",
    "teaser": "SIM -- short for \"Shape In Motion\" -- arrived on Tour with more hype than recent models, so we gave it the Tournament Player test",
    "articleText": "As we dive into this new decade there is one constant we can rely on, golf manufacturers continue to release new products to help us hit it straighter and further than the year before. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd while even the most avid equipment geeks don't advocate purchasing every model that comes out, it's safe to say that most tournament players feel left behind if they are playing with a driver that's more than one or two models old. <br><br>\r\n\r\nLike most of us, I feel a little envious of Tour players getting to play the latest gear, even before those models hit the market. After all, who doesn’t want to hit it further and straighter? So we head to the nearest demo day to try the latest and greatest hoping for a quantum leap in performance. The amazing part these days is that the manufactures have gotten it so dialed that if you blink you could miss out on some really cool technological innovation. <br><br>\r\n\r\nI recently tested TaylorMade’s newest Driver, the SIM, with high hopes. SIM -- which stands for Shape In Motion -- arrived on Tour with more hype than recent models, and I wanted to see what the new uniquely-shaped sole could deliver performance-wise.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTaylorMade has consistently delivered driver after driver, at least once a year. And while they may not always get it right, with this driver they nailed it. <br><br>\r\n\r\nI'm not a huge fan of the way the sole looks -- but the shape is a key element in the new design, and focus away from the sole and flip this driver around and put it in its address position, it all comes together. The colors are subtle and pleasing to the eye and with that it frames the golf ball extremely well -- a feature in their popular M1 Driver that I really liked. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe shape has more of a tear drop look to it that makes it look and feel stable upon your first waggle and with the graphite crown resembling an M Series BMW interior trim, the SIM feels built for speed.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSo aesthetically it passed the test for me, which is critical as I wouldn’t be motivated to hit it if not. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>THE TEST DRIVE</b><br>\r\nAfter the first swing you can truly hear that this driver sounds different. Obviously, sound translates to feel, and it feels solid. The pitch is low to mid-range which I truly like. Nothing worse than a pitchy driver and especially with range balls those octaves can get pretty high. \r\n\r\n<br><br>I was fortunate to try the driver with a shaft that works really well for me (Tense AV Series 65) so my launch and spin were dialed in. Even setting the loft at 10.5 the face sits very square. This is always an issue for me needing a little more loft and drivers starting to look a little more closed; not the case with the SIM.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe true test was taking out on the course for a test run and it did not disappoint. Everything about this driver instilled confidence. I was able to shape my tee shots very effectively from right to left, which is my go-to, but also hit the low peeler right when needed without the extra spin. Workability, sound, and feel -- it's not surprising that PGA Tour players on staff with TaylorMade made the switch pretty quickly.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>TUNEABILITY and PERFORMANCE</b><br>\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned I was not a huge fan of the sole shape, but as it turns out this wasn't something I gave much thought to when I addressed the ball. It is clear that the shape they created to balance out this driver works. In addition, with the sliding weight, you have the ability to create a desired shot shape. I personally liked leaving the weight in its neutral position. It seems a little overkill to have a driver weighted so well only to mess with it. But options are not a bad thing to have. You can always go to the SIM Max which doesn’t have the movable weight option and save a few dollars.<br><br>\r\n\r\nDepending on where you are with your current gamer (like, love, or hate) the TaylorMade SIM is definitely worth taking a look at.",

Texas A&M carded a final round 6-under par 274, which was the low round of the day, to hold off the Gators and finish the tournament at 13-under par (281-272-274=827).

    "teaser": "South Africa's Martin Vorster forces a playoff in dramatic fashion, then overcomes a weather delay and England's Olly Huggins",
    "articleText": "South Africa’s Martin Vorster boxed a 30-footer for eagle in the final hole of regulation play on Thursday to force a play-off, then wore down his opponent in the fourth hole of the sudden-death shoot-out to win the African Amateur Stroke Play Championship at Leopard Creek Country Club.\r\n\r\nThe 18-year-old Southern Cape golfer edged out Great Britain’s Olly Huggins when he made par on the first hole, after replaying the 18th three times was not enough to break the deadlock when both players finished on four-under-par for the tournament – and those play-off holes were interrupted by a lengthy weather delay after they had played 18 again twice.\r\n\r\n“It was unreal,” said Vorster. “I’m speechless. This win means so much to me.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nIt means a lot, because it was Vorster’s fourth international victory in four years after he won the 2017 Italian U-16 International, 2018 Junior Open and the 2019 East of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe GolfRSA National Squad member also captained the South African Junior Proteas to a record-setting 41-under-par victory in the Toyota Junior Golf World Cup in Japan last year – a full 18 years after Major champions Louis Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel captured the country’s first title with Albert Kruger and Christian Ries.\r\n\r\nFor long periods of the final round, Huggins was in control by virtue of his smart play and his great putting. He laid up on all the par-fives, aimed for the biggest part of the greens in the face of tough pin positions and then making putts when he needed them.\r\n\r\nVorster, however, was stalking him through the back nine.\r\n\r\nA birdie on 15 put him within two strokes of the lead. “I had a bit of a rough start,” he said. “After nine holes, I knew I was a bit behind and I had to make a few birdies. I made two on 13 and 15, and then missed a very short one on 17. I knew then that Olly had finished on four-under so I had to make the eagle on the last – thankfully it fell!”\r\n\r\nThat it did fall was in no small part due to some good putting all week.\r\n\r\n“The putting definitely saved me this week,” he said. “I made a few good ones down the stretch, and the one on 18 in regulation was the longest for the week and it happened at the right time.”\r\n\r\nFor the play-off, Vorster unfurled his power game, and Huggins, so conservative in regulation, was compelled to follow suit. It all worked well for the Huggins until they returned after the weather delay to set off down 18 for the third time.\r\n\r\nThe Louis Oosthuizen Golf Academy player took advantage of a tailwind that had picked up, and smashed his drive 40 metres further than he had at any time before during the week.\r\n\r\nIt left him a gentle wedge to the green on the par-five with the island green, and, although the pair shared the honours for the third time in the play-off, the change in the routine to the first had left Huggins clearly somewhat intimidated.\r\n\r\nAlthough Vorster smashed his drive into the right rough on the first - the next designated play-off hole – he had got into Huggins’ head.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe Englishman short-sided himself, Vorster recovered well enough to chip his third to a foot while Huggins was 20 feet away from the hole for three.\r\n\r\nAnd that was all Vorster needed.\r\n\r\n“I’m gutted obviously,” said Huggins, “but I’m really happy with the week. I’ve done what I said I was going to do, which was hit fairways, hit greens, make the putts – I played really nicely. I found out how to play this course after the first round when I shot four-over.”\r\n\r\nIn third place behind the dramatics provided by the play-off was Ryan van Velzen, who led through the first two rounds. The Benoni teenager recovered from his third-round blowout of 11-over-par 83 to post a final level-par 72 to end up on two-under, just two shots off the top of the leaderboard.\r\n\r\nEngland’s Joseph Long shot the round of the day with his six-under-par 66, one better than Huggins’ effort, and he shared fourth place with South Africa’s Jordan Duminy. The Irish duo of Caolan Rafferty and James Sugrue finished on three-over for the tournament to share sixth.\r\n\r\nFor Vorster, it was a victory to savour. “I just want to thank everybody for the support,” he said, “and the people who came out to watch the play-off. It was a relief to find my ball on that final hole, and then to get it up and down from the edge of the green was great.”",

The newer upper shoe materials do not stretch as badly as the older fully leather uppers, but they don’t breathe as well and tend to make my feet sweat a lot.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe Skechers Go Golf Elite V3 golf shoes seem to breathe better than shoes from the other manufacturers and they are not as heavy or as stiff feeling.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNormally when I get a new pair of shoes, I will wear them a few times when I am required to ride in a cart before walking a round in the shoes.  I only wore these shoes one time before walking a round and had no issues.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<table style=\"border:0px; float:right; padding:0px; border-spacing:0px\">\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059830.jpg\"/>\r\n</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\nThese are easily the most comfortable shoes I have ever played golf in.  There is enough structure that your feet don’t get too tired either.  The inside is really well cushioned on the top so nothing digs into the top of your feet when you tie them.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe only issue I found is that this version of the shoe ran a half size smaller than my normal shoe size.  I normally wear a size 11 and needed to trade them for a size 11½.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAt around $100, these are easily the best golf shoes I have ever owned, especially for the price.  I have 2 pairs now and am considering trying a newer version of the shoe.",

Smaller fields, bigger purses (The Genesis has $2M more in the pot this year -- not that Sean Yu will be able to play for it) and one more kicker.

Holmes (Kentucky), Abraham Ancer (Odessa), Ryan Moore (UNLV), CT Pan (Washington), Andrew Putnam (Pepperdine), Jhonattan Vegas (Texas) among others. The three-man pro-am teams compete against each other in best-ball play, with the lowest scoring team winning a $50,000 donation to the school’s golf program.

Fitzgerald and Streelman had a one-shot lead going into Sunday's final round.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald was the first African-American amateur to win the event -- which has been held since 1937 -- in 2018. Last season, when ASU product Paul Casey won with Fed Ex executive Don Colleran, Fitzgerald and Streelman didn't make the cut. Sunday, Fitzgerald finished about half the holes, relying on Streelman the rest of the time.\r\n\r\n\"I have a long way to go, just finding that consistency, especially off the tee,\" Fitzgerald told the Santa Cruz Sentinel. \"Once I get on the green, around the greens, I feel like I'm pretty comfortable.\"\r\n\r\nFitzgerald was only the seventh professional athlete to win the title, and the first since quarterback Dan Marino won in 1988. One-time major league pitcher Lefty O'Doul was the only other celebrity to be a two-time winner, and O'Doul didn't play until after his baseball career had ended. He is only the eighth amateur to have won more than once.\r\n\r\n\"It feels great,\" Fitzgerald said. \"Any time you can have success in a team format like this, it makes you feel good. Kevin is one of the best players in the world and I'm really happy for him.\"\r\n\r\nFitzgerald signed a one-year contract last month to commit to playing a 17th season with the Cardinals. In December, Fitzgerald talked about his golf game and how much more he might play once he retires -- and Fitzgerald downplayed such conversation, talking about grander plans in his life.\r\n\r\n\"I love playing golf but I'm not making the world a better place by playing it,\" Fitzgerald said.",

    "teaser": "Far from home, the Duke Blue Devils beat a strong field that included 9 top-10 teams at Palos Verdes Golf Club",
    "articleText": "What an impressive way to open the spring slate for the Duke women's golf program as the Blue Devils claimed the team title at the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge against nine top 10 teams and one of the best fields of the season.  \r\n\r\nFollowing a solid 11-under-par, 273, Monday, the Blue Devils held an eight-stroke lead heading into the final round.  Duke carded a one-under-par, 283, and collected a seven-stroke victory at the 6,017-yard, par 71 Palos Verdes Golf Club in Palos Verdes Estates, Calif.\r\n\r\nIn eight appearances at the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge, it marked the first team title for the Blue Devils and the 137th career victory for Duke head coach Dan Brooks, which continues to lead all NCAA Division I head coaches.  \r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n\"Today was even more fun than yesterday,\" commented Brooks.  \"Seventeen birdies on the back nine. Although we shot lower yesterday, our golf seemed just as good today.  The flag locations were tougher today. Everyone contributed important rounds for the event. Ana (Belac) was a rock out there.  Miranda's (Wang) winter work on her swing really paid off, almost getting the individual win.  Megan (Furtney) shot even for the event on a very interesting and difficult course she'd never seen before. I'm real proud of this team.\"\r\n\r\nDuke carded rounds of 291, 273 and 283 for a five-under, 847, which broke the previous Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge tournament record by nine strokes.  Southern California (854), Texas (855), UCLA (858), Arizona State (859), Kent State (868), Stanford (869), Wake Forest (870), Auburn (872) and Oregon (876) rounded out the top 10 teams.\r\n\r\nThe Blue Devils got off to a slow start Tuesday and fell into a tie for first, but never trailed.  After moving back to even par for the tournament and six-over-par to start the morning, Duke came through big on the back nine with 17 back nine birdies to seal the victory.  \r\n\r\nThe Blue Devils featured junior Miranda Wang and senior Ana Belac in the top five of the individual leaderboard as Wang was tied for second and Belac placed tied for fifth.  \r\n\r\nWang carded the best finish of her Duke career along with the best 54-hole ledger as a Blue Devil as she carded a five-under-par, 208, with rounds of 74, 66 and 68.  A product of Beijing, China, Wang opened her day on hole No. 2 with a bogey, but then collected birdies on No. 6 and No. 8 to move into the red.  She then had a bogey on No. 9, birdie on No. 11 and bogey on No. 12.  Wang then collected four straight birdies from holes 14 through 17 to get to four-under-par.  She went on to finish the day with a bogey on No. 1 to shoot a three-under-68.  \r\n\r\nShe led the field with a total of 17 birdies. Wang hit 13 greens, 10 fairways and added 28 putts on the final day.\r\n\r\nAuburn's Kaleigh Telfer won the individual title with a six-under-par, 207, one stroke ahead of Wang and Arizona State's Olivia Mehaffey (208).\r\n\r\nTurning in her second top 10 finish at the Northrop Grumman, Belac carded rounds of 74, 66 and 70 on her way to finishing tied for fifth with a 210.  She notched two pars over her first two holes and then had three bogeys over a span of four holes, while also collecting a birdie on the par five fifth.  \r\n\r\nBelac, who is from Portoroz, Slovenia, made the turn at two-over-par, 37, and then had her irons working on the back.  She hit it stiff on the 355-yard, par four 11th and sank the four-foot birdie, while also connecting on a three-foot birdie on No. 14.  Belac added another birdie on the par five 16th and would finish with a one-under-par, 71.  She hit 11 greens, 10 fairways and had 27 putts.  \r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n\"I'm really proud how everyone contributed to the win,\" said Belac.  \"It shows how solid everyone on the team is. Obviously, it's awesome to start the season with a win, but I think for a team as ambitious as ours, it just adds to the motivation to work even harder for the remaining of the season.\"\r\n\r\nMegan Furtney, a native of St. Charles, Ill., was competing in her second collegiate event and posted her first top 15 finish of her short time as a Blue Devil.  Over the three days, she notched three straight rounds of even-par, 71, to finish with an even-par, 213.  \r\n\r\nIn the final round, she opened her morning on No. 4 and collected six straight pars.  After a double-bogey on No. 10, Furtney collected two six-foot birdie putts in a row to get back to even par.  She then suffered a triple-bogey on the 404-yard, par four 13th, but once again rebounded strong.  Furtney reeled off a birdie on the 404-yard, par four 14th as she nearly drove the green and then got up and down for birdie.  \r\n\r\nOn the 140-yard, par three 15th, Furtney hit her 9-iron to seven feet and rolled in the birdie and then two-putted for birdie on the par five 16th to finish off her third straight birdie to move back to even for the day.  Furtney closed with a bogey on No. 18, hit her 9-iron from 123 yards to six feet for birdie on No. 1 and parred the final two holes to finish with a 71.  She hit 12 greens, eight fairways and rolled 28 putts in the final round.  \r\n\r\nAfter collecting rounds of 72 and 70 the first two days, sophomore Gina Kim signed for a 78 on the final day.  She registered back-to-back birdies on No. 11 and No. 12 on her way to placing tied for 29th with a 222.  \r\n\r\nErica Shepherd teed off on No. 5 to start the day and was three-over-par through five holes.  The rookie from Greenwood, Ind., came back to drain a five-foot birdie on the 263-yard, par four 12th and then drove the green on No. 14, before two-putting for birdie to get back to one-over.  She would go on to finish with a three-over-par, 74, and finished tied for 67th with a 229.  \r\n\r\nThe Blue Devils collected 22 birdies in the final round and closed the three days with a total of 54 birdies to lead the field.\r\n\r\n<i>-- Thanks to Duke Women's Golf for this report.</i>",

    "teaser": "John Pak and Florida State won for the third straight year in Mobile, but the top 5 teams were only separated by 6 shots",
    "articleText": "The Florida State Men’s Golf team has started to become synonymous with impressive finishes at the Mobile Sports Authority Intercollegiate.\r\n\r\n“Obviously really proud of the guys for a great start to the spring season,” FSU head coach Trey Jones said. “Especially proud of it being a team effort. We had some gut checks by some young guys today that had some things happen that they bounced back from beautifully.”\r\n\r\nThe Seminoles entered the competition with consecutive tournament titles in Mobile, and the course once again proved favorable as junior All-American John Pak won another individual championship that helped Florida State secure their third straight tournament title in Mobile, Alabama.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nFlorida State held off a third-round push from red-hot Louisville and Illinois to finish first in Mobile at 28-under (278-281-277). Illinois placed second at just a stroke behind at 27-under, followed by Louisville (-26), UAB (-22) and first-day leader Texas State (-22).\r\n\r\n“John Pak winning by six shows the quality of player he is,” Jones added. “He put the team on his back. Also Jamie Li shoots a bogey-free 68. These guys are showing the young guys the way. When you get 10-under from those guys and the other guys are learning… we’re getting better.”\r\n\r\nPak scored a 6-under on the final round to outshine Texas State’s Calvin Ross and Logan Lockwood. The performance followed up an impressive 9-under through the first two rounds. He finished with a tournament score of 15-under par that included a first-place tie in birdies, carding birdies on 17 out of his 54 holes and led the field with a 3.72 scoring average on the Par 4 holes.\r\n\r\nThis is Pak’s sixth career tournament title, sitting in second in program history behind only Nolan Henke’s eight career wins from 1983-87.\r\n\r\nThe All-American was not the only Seminole who impressed Tuesday.\r\n\r\nSenior Jamie Li completed a final round of 4-under. The final round was highlighted by his exceptional play on the final back nine where he carded three of his 13 birdies. The strong finish moved him up six spots from 14th to place to a tie for eighth.\r\n\r\nThe sophomore duo of Calvin Sierota and Alberto Martinez added strong invitational scores. Sierota scored a 3-under through three rounds, and Martinez followed with a 1-under on the final round. Florida State hopes these finishes are indications of progression and continued contribution that will prove to be important throughout the spring season.\r\n\r\n“Calvin had a triple bogey on the 11th hole and comes back with an eagle. Alberto was struggling and was two over par through eight holes and finished one under par,” Jones said. “We don’t have a chance if he didn’t do that and compete as hard as he did.”\r\n\r\nCole Anderson tied for 40th and rounded out the rest of the lineup with a 1-over par.\r\n\r\n<i>-- Thanks to Florida State Men's Golf for this report.</i>",

    "teaser": "South Africa's top junior has a four-shot lead at Randpark Golf Club",
    "articleText": "Overnight leader Casey Jarvis held steady during round three to take a commanding four-shot lead into the final round of the South African Stroke Play Championship at Randpark Golf Club.\r\n\r\nThe fearsome Firethorn Course had proved scoreable in the first two rounds after torrential rain on the eve of the event had softened up the greens.\r\n\r\nJarvis opened with rounds of 66 and 65 to open up a two shot lead, but firmer greens and breezy conditions in the afternoon made it a different proposition on Wednesday, but the country’s top junior got around in 67 strokes to get to 18-under-par.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“I just kept it in play really nicely, as I’ve done over the first two days,” said the 16-year-old Boksburg resident. “That’s the key to scoring well here; hitting fairways and greens. I was driving it really well and I’m putting well too. On a course like this you can score well if you hit the fairways, but if you don’t you can really struggle.”\r\n\r\nJarvis began the season with victory in the Free State Open and he carded rounds of 69, 63, 64 and 63 at Centurion Country Club to win the Gauteng North Open by eight shots. Now he is targeting one of the two flagship titles on the GolfRSA and with 22 birdies and just four bogeys in 54 holes, his chances keep improving.\r\n\r\n“I got it to 19-under, but I had a three-putt bogey on the 16th. I was still putting really well on the back nine, but a lot of them burned the edge or stopped in the jaws. You just have to accept it and move on; I’m learning how to use the frustration to build positive energy.”\r\n\r\nAlthough happy to sleep on a four-shot cushion, Jarvis is taking nothing for granted, least of all Irishman Rowan Lester in the chasing pack.\r\n\r\n“I have always wanted to win the SA Stroke Play and the SA Amateur, but I’m not going to change my strategy for the final round. Rowan is a really good golfer, so I expect him to make a charge. The greens are only going to get firmer, so I am sticking to my game plan. Nothing heroic, just fairways and greens.”\r\n\r\nTwo off the pace after rounds of 66 and 67, a steady 69 helped Lester to stay in touch.\r\n\r\n“It was a really steady round,” said the former North of Ireland champion golfer. “I offset a pair of bogeys with five birdies and the highlight of my round was on the ninth, where I stuck it in the bunker and then holed the trap-shot for birdie to keep the momentum going.\r\n\r\n“The greens were much firmer and it was a lot harder to get it out of the rough if you missed the fairways. I’m pretty happy with a 69 and I look forward to a nice battle with Casey tomorrow,”\r\n\r\nSouth Africa’s Kyle de Beer and Caolan Rafferty from Ireland emerged as the next closest challengers. Port Elizabeth’s De Beer matched Jarvis with a 67 to move to 11-under while a seven-under 65 propelled Dundalk golfer Rafferty to fourth on 10-under.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nYoung Amilkar Bhana showed some serious big match temperament, playing alongside Haider Hussain from England and South Africa’s number one ranked Martin Vorster.\r\n\r\nThe 15-year-old reigning Nomads SA Boys U-17 champion and 2019 Reply Italian U-16 Championship winner knocked in a birdie putt at the final hole for a round of 70 and made it a five-way tie on nine-under. Also tied for fifth were Frenchman Nicolas Muller and compatriots Dirkus Joubert, Keagan Thomas and Kieron van Wyk.\r\n\r\nAfrican Amateur Stroke Play Championship winner Vorster and Gloucestershire's Hussain are a further shot back after respective rounds of 71 and 72, with Ernie Els and Fancourt Foundation standout Siyanda Mwandla (69) and James Sugrue from Ireland (72) in joint 10th.",

    "title": "16 years old and 25 under: Jarvis takes South African Stroke Play",
    "teaser": "Casey Jarvis breaks a 51-year-old record and announces himself as the next big thing in South African golf",
    "articleText": "Casey Jarvis etched his name into the record books as the youngest winner in South African Stroke Play Championship history when he claimed the prestigious title in dominant fashion at Randpark Golf Club on Thursday.\r\n\r\nAt 16 years, 6 months and 17 days, Jarvis broke a record that had been held for 51 years when he triumphed with a winning aggregate of 25-under-par 263 – a full nine strokes clear of his nearest competitor, Port Elizabeth’s Kyle de Beer.\r\n\r\nThe Boksburg teenager eclipsed the previous mark held by the renowned Dale Hayes, who won the first edition of the flagship event at 16 years and 8 months at Humewood Golf Club in 1969.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nIn January, Jarvis shot to No 1 in the GolfRSA Open Amateur rankings with successive victories in the Free State and Gauteng North Opens. He briefly relinquished the top spot on Monday to African Amateur Stroke Play Championship winner Martin Vorster, but this latest victory has propelled the State Mines golfer back to the summit.\r\n\r\nHis performance around the 6,746-metre, par-72 Firethorn Course, where a month earlier the European Tour’s elite players battled it out for the South African Open Championship, gave new meaning to the old cliché of ‘he came, he saw, he conquered’.\r\n\r\nJarvis laid down a marker with an opening six-under-par 66, opened up a two-shot lead with a second round 67 and stretched his advantage to four shots with a round of 65 on moving day. Over 54 holes, he racked up 22 birdies and surrendered just four shots. That birdie tally would swell to 27 as the State Mines golfer toured Firethorn on the final day in flawless fashion.\r\n\r\nHe opened with three straight pars, followed by a trio of birdies from the par-five fourth and made the turn on 21-under. Leading De Beer and Irishman Rowan Lester by eight shots, Jarvis put on a real show on the back nine – a fourth gain on the par -five 12th, a chip-in eagle at the par-five 14th and a final birdie at the par-four 16th.\r\n\r\nTwo rock solid pars on the closing holes put an exclamation mark behind his feat.\r\n\r\nHis success came down to an unwavering belief that he could win, his affinity for the Firethorn Course and his partnership with legendary caddie Tiger Lekhune – the man who once famously told Tiger Woods “Nice to meet you, but I'm the original Tiger”, and who carried the bag for most of Major champion Nick Price’s 48 victories worldwide. He also helped steer Jarvis to victory in Randpark in the Joburg Junior Open last December.\r\n\r\n“My dad almost always carries for me and we’ve won some big ones,” said Jarvis. “Tiger took the bag for the Joburg Junior Open, so I asked him to carry for me again this week. He’s been at Randpark for more than 25 years, and he reads the greens better than anyone I know.\r\n\r\n“He is also good at calming me down. I am very fast. I walk fast, I hit fast and I putt fast. Because he is slower, he slows me down. It actually helps me to focus. He is so experienced and he knows just when to speak up and when to back off. It’s been a great week for us.”\r\n\r\nAs for his love affair with Firethorn, Jarvis says it is all about the greens.\r\n\r\n“I love these greens. They are so pure and run so true. If you steer your ball on the right line and with the right pace, then the putts drop centre cup every time. I drove the ball really well and barely missed a fairway or a green all week. And my putting was on song.\r\n\r\n“When I’m playing like this, I know I can win and I know I can win big. I just go out there, believe it and I make it happen.”\r\n\r\nThe teenager reflected on the week, and a final round that will live long in his memory.\r\n\r\n“This has been a dream. To win the SA Stroke Play is the best achievement of my career. It was a magic week where I really played my best golf and got rewarded for it. Now I’m going to switch off for a day and then turn my focus the AON SA Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“My other goals are to lift the Proudfoot Trophy and the SA Amateur title. If I can play well in the qualifier and win it, it will put me in a good position for the match play. I love Royal Johannesburg and Kensington; it’s one of my most favourite courses, so taking a game this solid to the SA Amateur feels really good.”\r\n\r\nThe ground-breaking AON SA Amateur Championships will see the Women’s and Men’s Championships being played concurrently on the East and West Courses of Royal Johannesburg and Kensington Golf Club from 16-21 February.\r\n\r\nJarvis will not be the only player to fancy his chances next week.\r\n\r\nGolfRSA National Squad stablemate Kyle de Beer carded rounds of 67, 71, 67 and 67 to finish alone in second on 16-under. The Ernie Els and Fancourt Foundation will take a healthy amount of confidence to the flagship event, as will Irishman Caolan Rafferty – a semi-finalist in last year’s SA Amateur.\r\n\r\nThe Dundalk golfer closed with 67 to finish in third on 15-under. South African pair Keagan Thomas and Kieron van Wyk produced a pair of 68s to share fourth a further stroke back.",

Here are some of the best new tournaments to consider adding to your playing schedule.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059886.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px; font-weight:bold\">SOUTHWESTERN WOMEN'S AMATEUR</span><br>\r\n<b>Desert Mountain Golf Club, Scottsdale, Ariz.</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nFor the past 104 years, the Southwestern Amateur has been a men's-only event that has attracted some of the nation's finest amateur players. In 2020, the tournament is taking a major step to help expand the game by introducing a women's championship for the nation's top female amateurs.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe men and women will compete concurrently in a 72-hole competition, and a mixed-team competition will also be held, with the champion male-female team determined after the second round. In fact, players are encouraged to enter as a mixed team and will receive priority entry, though individual entries will be taken. Many players and college coaches have responded positively to the new format.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nJohn Ranslem, executive director of the Southwestern Golf Association which conducts the event, said the change in format was made \"after careful consideration of changes in the game, and the recognition of the increasing impact that women are having on the game.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/6341/Glencoe-Invitational\">Glencoe Invitational</a> in Canada has made a similar change for 2020, introducing a women's division to a long-running men's championship. The practice is common in Australia, but a little more ground-breaking in North America.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/992/Southwestern-Amateur-Championship\">More information about the Southwestern Men's and Women's Amateur</a><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059885.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px; font-weight:bold\">SOS NATIONAL SUPER SENIOR CHAMPIONSHIP</span><br>\r\n<b>Forest Creek Golf Club, Pinehurst, N.C.</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nIt's rare that a new tournament makes our <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/TheMajorsOfAmateurGolf/SuperSenior\">Majors Calendar</a>, but this one does. This tournament will be conducted by the Society of Seniors (SOS) and will aim to be the top super senior championship in the United States. The tournament will be 54 holes of stroke play and will be open to players ages 65 and over.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe elite field of super seniors will include top point holders on the World Amateur Golf Ranking (WAGR) points list, the SOS's own Super Senior Points list, and Golfweek’s Super Senior Points list. In addition, top finishers in a select list of super senior championships will also be exempt.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/9240/Society-of-Seniors-National-Super-Senior-Championship\">More information about the SOS National Super Senior Championship</a><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059884.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px; font-weight:bold\">EAST WEST MATCHES</span><br>\r\n<b>Maridoe Golf Club, Carrollton, Texas</b><br><br>\r\n \r\nAnother newcomer to the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/TheMajorsOfAmateurGolf/MidAmMen\">Majors Calendar</a>, the East West Matches will feature Ryder Cup-style team matches for American mid-amateurs and seniors. The Mississippi River is the dividing line between East and West teams, and each team is comprised of 18 players: 6 seniors, at least 10 mid-amateurs, and up to 2 amateurs who haven't yet reached the age of 25.<br><br>\r\n\r\n50% of each team will automatically qualify through points earned by finish in major amateur tournaments, with the other 50% chosen by the tournament committee. Teams will be selected at the conclusion of the U.S. Mid-Amateur and U.S. Senior Amateur championships.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nEach team will be captained by amateur golf royalty. Paul Simson will captain the East team, with Tim Jackson the assistant captain.

The field will be select at 72 players, with exemptions granted based on ranking and performance in USGA championships.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/8870/Amateur-Golf-Alliance-Women-s-Amateur-Championship\">More information about the AGA Women's Amateur Championship</a><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00059893.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size:20px; font-weight:bold\">FATHER-SON LINKS CHAMPIONSHIP AT BANDON DUNES</span><br>\r\n<b>Bandon Golf Resort, Bandon, Ore.</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe addition of the Father-Son Division to the Two Man Links Championship pushed the tournament to brink of a sellout in near-record time. The 72-hole two-man best-ball tournament is played on four different courses at one of golf's most inspiring venues (and bucket-list destination), Bandon Dunes.

Golfers still enjoy the benefit of the symbiotic relationship between land and stadium.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe two courses (together called Brookside Golf Club) were the first public courses in Southern California. And while they may need a little cleanup after each game or concert, most of the year belongs to public golfers.

    "articleText": "Harry Goddard became the first Englishman since Eddie Pepperell in 2011 to win the Portuguese International Men's Amateur Championship. Pedro Lencart, runner-up, was very close to being the third straight member of the Portuguese national team to win in successive years.\r\n\r\nGoddard, with a total of 269 (71-65-67-66), ended up prevailing by one shot over Lencart (68-69-65-68) and the Eduard Rousaud (68-68-66-68) of Spain, both with 270 (-18). The Portuguese-Spanish pair had started the last 18 holes tied at the front with a total of -14.\r\n\r\nLencart shone with birdies on holes 15, 16 and 17, but a bogey on the par-3 18th prevented him from forcing a playoff with Goddard.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n\"I can't believe it, I still can't digest it,\" said Goddard of the win. \"I played well all week. I didn't make too many mistakes, I stayed true to the game plan.\"\r\n\r\n\"I started well, but at the turn I felt a little nervous. But I pulled myself together and made birdies in four of the last five holes.\"\r\n\r\nIn his fourth time playing in the event, the 20-year-old Goddard started the day tied with Dutchman Stan Kraai and Norwegian Herman Wibe Sekne, jumping to victory with the day's low round, a 6-under 66.\r\n\r\nStan Kraai was 4th, with 271 (70-66-67-68), -14, and Englishman Joshua Bristow, with 274 (70-67-70-67), completed the top 5 of the tournament.",

    "articleText": "<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/53652/Jason-Anthony\">Jason Anthony</a> of Fairfield posted 3-under 137 over the weekend to earn medalist honors for the second time at The San Francisco City Championship.<br><br>\r\n\r\nPlaying his first round at the 2020 PGA Championship host course TPC Harding Park, Anthony looked at some of the preparations being made for the PGA, and liked what he saw.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"They manicured around the greens and especially the bunkers much better,\" said Anthony. They also cleaned up a lot of areas around the trees.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nAll of those differences would tend to lower scores. But Anthony and the rest of the field had to deal with fairways that are half their normal width, and rough that is longer than usual for this time of year in San Francisco. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n\"It’s much longer than normal, but not 'PGA-bad' yet,\" he said.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAnthony, at age 36, may be one of the elder statesman in a field that includes many high school and college players. But experience is everything in \"The City,\" and having a title under your belt -- <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/20763/Champions-Crowned-at-102nd-San-Francisco-City\">Anthony won in 2018</a> -- is a mental advantage that the USGA-seasoned Anthony will take into each of his matches.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"There's just kind of a calm over me when I play in this tournament,\" explained Anthony of his success in San Francisco.  \"I never really know what to expect coming in because it is my first tournament of the year, with usually not much opportunity to get out and practice much [prior]\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nAll championship division matches are played at <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-courses/CA/San-Francisco/1113/TPC-Harding-Park-Golf-Course\">TPC Harding Park</a>, with the first round getting underway next Saturday. But Anthony and the rest of the field have to play one of their qualifying rounds at <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-courses/CA/San-Francisco/1205/Lincoln-Park-Golf-Course\">Lincoln Park</a>, one of the most public courses in the country, but also one of the most diabolical. With a yardage of 5400, a par of 68, and a rating/slope of 65.5/107, one has to wonder why the scores at Lincoln Park are almost the same as those at TPC Harding Park, which will host a major in May.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"Lincoln is 5400 yard monster,\" explained Anthony. \"It's one of the toughest mental tests of the year, with the bad lies, mud, and tiny targets. And this year the greens were firm which made it even more difficult.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nUnless you've stood on the 17th tee, staring down a small target 240 yards below, with OB in the road right and one of the seven wonders of the modern world -- The Golden Gate Bridge --down below the cliffs on the left, and needing to finish par-par to make the cut, you won't know why scores can skyrocket at Lincoln Park.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAnthony wasn't worried about the cut, sitting at 3-under on that tee with just two holes to play, but he kept his foot on the gas and finished par-par before heading back to Harding Park, where players gather for scoring and a possible playoff for the last of the 32 match play spots.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis year, 7-over 147 was the magic number. Six players at that number breathed a sigh of relief after learning a potential seventh person on the number had been disqualified. No playoff, the numbers were perfect.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nUSF junior Alex Chin of Pleasanton and steady Mid-Am golfer Andrew Biggadike of Belmont finished at even par 140. Three players -- Darren Pang, Charles Porter, and Michael Jensen -- posted 141.<br><br>\r\n\r\nPang, a high school junior from San Ramon, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25842/AGC-Winter-Invitational--Pang-gets-first-am-win-at-Corica-Park\">picked up his first amateur golf win</a> at the AmateurGolf.com Winter Invitational across the bay at Corica Park in December. He impressed against a field loaded with collegiate players on winter break. Porter, of San Francisco, attends Napa Valley College, while Jensen is a Cal Berkeley graduate finding his sea-legs as a working amateur golfer.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMatch play will be even more exciting this year as players test themselves at a major championship layout. One of them (Anthony) has a the sting of a <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/23631/Peterson-finds-his-inner-fire-in-winning-San-Francisco-City\">loss in the finals to Evan Peterson</a> as his mind as he readies for match play.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I have some unfinished business after losing in the finals last year.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nOne thing is for sure, everyone in that advanced to match play is happy to be playing Harding Park again next weekend. Anthony gave kudos to the tournament committee for finding a way to pull off the tournament as preparations for something bigger are underway.",

    "title": "South African Match Play: Samuel Simpson is medalist",
    "teaser": "Simpson nailed a decisive two iron, leading to an eagle and being qualifying medalist at the South African Match Play",
    "articleText": "by Lali Stander, GolfRSA\r\n\r\nJOHANNESBURG, 17 February 2020 – He called it possibly the best two-iron of his life, and it set up what turned out to be a decisive eagle for Samuel Simpson as he went on to win the Proudfoot Trophy for topping the 36-hole stroke play qualifier for the match play stage of the Aon South African Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\nAfter making three birdies in the opening seven holes to pull himself into a share of the lead, which stood at 10-under after Casey Jarvis set the clubhouse target in the morning at Royal Johannesburg and Kensington Golf Club in the morning, Simpson eagled eight to go into a lead which he never relinquished as he made one more birdie on his way in after the turn.\r\n\r\n“I took three-wood off the tee on the eighth hole just to put myself into position,” said the 17-year-old Western Province golfer. “I had 245 to the flag and I hit a great two-iron to about three feet and rolled that one in for eagle. That was really cool.”\r\n\r\nThere are some big names on the Proudfoot Trophy, including Major winner Trevor Immelman, European Tour winners Brandon Stone and Haydn Porteous and more recently, former Freddie Tait Cup winner Jovan Rebula. “It’s great,” said Simpson. “I haven’t really thought about the names that have been on it, but it will be really cool to see my name on it in the future.”\r\n\r\nThe East Course at Royal Johannesburg is a stern test and, for Simpson to have gone bogey-free as he held on to his three-stroke edge over Jarvis, countryman Christiaan Maas and England’s Joseph Long was an impressive feat.\r\n\r\nHe felt his putter let him down somewhat in last week’s South African Stroke Play Championship which Jarvis romped away with. “It was not the best putting performance from me last week,” said Simpson. “This week, it’s only two weeks done, but the putter was definitely rolling and I’m looking forward to more like it in the match play.”\r\n\r\nJarvis got it to 11-under as he looked to be on his way to a possible second title inside two weeks, but he incurred a penalty stroke for inadvertently marking and lifting his ball which was just on the edge of a green. That saw him finish at 10-under, and although that was three strokes back, he’s in a good space going into the match play.\r\n\r\n“I played some good golf out there,” said Jarvis. “I’m really confident heading into the match play. I’m pleased for my friend Sam for winning the Proudfoot – he deserves it because he’s been playing very well lately.”\r\n\r\nLong’s seven-under-par 65 will be the new course record at Royal after the course underwent some extensive renovation and changes ahead of its reopening last year in January.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman started his round with a birdie on the 10th, which could have disheartened him, but didn’t. “I had a good bounce-back after the bogey with two birdies in a row,” said Long, “and then I had another bogey. I dropped the eagle on 18. It was two great shots in and I holed an 18-footer. Then I hit another two good shots and holed a six-footer on one. The putter was just on fire, really.”\r\n\r\nAs the top 64 players go into the match play, the East Course is going to ask some questions of them as they scheme to bring down an opponent, rather than trying to overpower the course.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“There are some really demanding tee shots that you have to step up and commit to. There are tighter fairways. I prefer that and I’m mentally prepared for that,” said Long\r\n\r\nFor Simpson, the satisfaction of winning the Proudfoot Trophy helps his state of mind going into the shoot-out which is match play. “I started yesterday with a nice seven-under which put me in a good position to go out there today and shoot a low number,” he said. “I just have to put things into perspective and tell myself that it’s only two rounds done. There are a lot of match play rounds left. I’ve just got to focus on going out there tomorrow and playing the best I can.”\r\n\r\nThe final spots for the first round of the knock-out stages was decided in a 10-man play-off on two-over-par 146, with Frenchman Elliot Anger and South Africans Siyanda Mwandla and Christopher Gutuza coming up trumps.",

With his hot streak, and unique swing, it wasn't uncommon for a small crowd of club members and onlookers to gather around him while he was going through his range warm-up. \r\n\r\nPlus, he was heading into the event looking for an amazing fifth-straight individual collegiate title. His Oklahoma State Cowboys were ranked No. 1, and while LSU took the team title and Wolff's streak was broken, a member of his team (2018 U.S. Am champ Viktor Hovland) did shoot 8-under to win the individual title.\r\n\r\nWith both players securing PGA Tour cards, and Oklahoma State not in the current top-25, it's apparent that things change quickly in college golf.

Paced by a 6-under 65 by Spencer Soosman in today's final round, Texas extended their five stroke 36-hole lead by firing 6-under today.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the process, they held off No. 2 ranked Pepperdine by 6 shots. <br><br>\r\n\r\nPierceson Coody (69); Cole Hammer (71) contributed for Texas, along with Parker Coody who posted 2-over 73 for the fourth counting score.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nLeo Oyo of San Diego State wouldn't have believe you last year if you told him that he would be able to capture a collegiate title anywhere, let alone a course where he struggled. Yet that's exactly what he did, posting 11-under for the individual title.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOyo's three eagles on the week alongside a triple bogey tell part of the story. But it was his short game, especially down the stretch, that tells the rest of it. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter two important up-and-downs on Nos. 14 and 15, Oyo's third eagle of the week came on the 16th today, giving him the outright individual lead at 11-under. A long two putt from the fringe on the difficult par-3 17th, followed by a classy up-and-down from the closely mown area over the green and short-sided on No. 18 ensured that Oyo would capture his first collegiate title.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut there's more to the story. Oyo was brought to tears by the turnaround in his game over the past year. <br><br>\r\n\r\n\"This means so much -- I came in DFL here last year,\" said Oyo in a Golfweek live stream interview with Will Haskett.<br><br> \r\n\r\nIn fact, a look back at 2019 scores show rounds of 80, 77, and 79 for Oyo, and a 77th place finish in a field of 82 players. At 23-over last year vs. 11-under this year, Oyo improved by a full 34 strokes, or more than eleven shots per round. (This year his rounds were 68, 68, 66.)<br><br>\r\n\r\nSpencer Soosman of Texas had four birdies on the front nine today en route to a 32, and had a bogey-free back nine of 3-under 33 to post 65, just one stroke off the low round of the tournament. It was the kind of round Texas needed to keep themselves separated from the pack.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe low round of the event was posted today by Austin Eckroat of Oklahoma State. While his team (minus last year's champ Viktor Hovland and the amazing Matthew Wolff) has fallen out of the top-25, credit Eckroat and his teammates with a gutsy performance, jumping into 5th place with today's 8-under total, the low team total of the day.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOyo's performance, plus a solid 67 from teammate Puwit Anupansuebsai, put SDSU in third behind Pepperdine, with Texas Tech finishing fourth.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFinishing in second as an individual behind Oyo was Eckroat (10-under) with Soosman a shot back in third at 9-under.",

    "articleText": "Not even a two-hour delay due to dangerous weather could halt the relentless charge of South Africa’s two top-ranked golfers – Caitlyn Macnab and Casey Jarvis – towards their place in golf history.\r\n\r\nWith their wins in the Aon South African Amateur Championships, Macnab and Jarvis both achieved the rare SA Amateur double – winning the Aon Women’s and Men’s South African Stroke Play Championships and Amateur Championships in the same calendar year.\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25943/16-years-old-and-25-under--Jarvis-takes-South-African-Stroke-Play\">16 years old and 25 under: Jarvis takes South African Stroke Play</a>\r\n\r\nAstonishingly, in the first year that the women’s and men’s championships were played in the same week and at the same course, the extra-ordinary Ekurhuleni pair added to an even rarer piece of history.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe last time the double of the Aon South African Stroke Play Championship and the Aon South African Amateur Championship was achieved by both men and women was in 2007, when Ashleigh Simon and Louis de Jager prevailed.\r\n\r\nJarvis became the youngest champion in history of the SA Stroke Play Championship with his nine-stroke runaway victory at Randpark Golf Club a week ago and on Friday, the 16-year-old State Mines golfer ended the run of Scotland’s James Wilson with a comfortable 7&6 victory on Royal Johannesburg & Kensington’s East Course.\r\n\r\nJarvis is the 10th double winner since the SA Amateur Championship switched to a match play format in 1925.\r\n\r\nMacnab celebrated her 18th birthday by claiming the SA Women’s Stroke Play Championship crown on Tuesday and three days later, the Serengeti golfer downed 14-year-old Kyra van Kan 4&3 in the 36-hole match play final. She is the 13th calendar double champion of the women’s flagship events.\r\n\r\nMacnab was a huge favourite to win the final as the number one ranked woman golfer in South Africa, but surprisingly she fell behind early to Van Kan.\r\n\r\n“I think I was half asleep on the first nine,” she said. “I hit one green in the first seven holes and short-sided myself on the ones that I missed. Kyra was playing steady and all of a sudden I was 3 down, so I had to work really hard to get it back.\r\n\r\nShe was two down after the first 18 holes but fought back and turned the match around, winning with a par on the 15th hole.\r\n\r\n“It feels awesome,” Macnab said. “To win one of these events is really special so to win both in the same year is just amazing. This is two big items ticked off the bucket list, so I guess I’ll need to reset a few goals this year.”\r\n\r\nShe had some words of encouragement for Van Kan, who was bidding to break Ashleigh Simon’s record as the youngest ever winner of the Aon SA Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\n“I am so impressed by how Kyra carried herself and how she played the entire week,” said Macnab. “She’s done incredibly well and she’s really announced herself as someone to look out for in the future.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nSixteen-year-old Jarvis was delighted to have added the title to his impressive resume.  \r\n\r\n“I’m a bit lost for words at the moment,” he said. “I was mentally tired after last week, so to come here and manage to get the win is something that I’m extremely proud of.\r\n\r\nHis dominance was built around five birdies in the last six holes of the first 18 holes.\r\n\r\n“I made some good putts coming down the stretch that gave me a 4-up lead at the turn,” he said. “It allowed me to play freely on the second round and after I won the 19th and 20th to go 6-up, I felt I could play a bit safer. I knew I couldn’t relax because James is a very good player, so I stuck to my game plan, I just didn’t attack the pins.”\r\n\r\nThe SA Women’s Amateur launched in 1906 and the SA Amateur dates back to 1892.\r\n\r\nThis year marked the first time in the history of the event that the men’s and women’s championships were played simultaneously and the players enjoyed the experience tremendously.\r\n\r\n“Having Aon as a sponsor has been incredible,” said Macnab. “The branding, the look and the feel of the championship was completely different. They have really lifted the scale of the event and we can feel it, especially on the women’s side. It felt like a professional golf tournament, like when you go to the South African Open.\r\n\r\n“Sharing the championship with the men has been great. The vibe was fantastic, even if we sometimes bumped elbows on the putting green. It was great to go and cheer the guys on in their qualifier, and then to see them return the favour and support us in the SA Stroke Play final. The vibe has been good and we’ve all cheered each other on.”\r\n\r\nJarvis was equally impressed by the new format of the tournament, which will stay at Royal Johannesburg & Kensington for the next two years.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“It’s a lot of fun playing with the women and they really made the week more special. We loved playing here at Royal Johannesburg and Kensington. To play top courses in the Aon SA Amateur was such a privilege and we are really excited to know that we are coming back next year.”\r\n\r\nLadina Semadeni from Switzerland claimed her first amateur victory when she defeated Boland junior Ineke Brynard 2-up for the Flight Division title. “I am so excited that I decided to come and compete in South Africa,” gushed the Swiss miss.\r\n\r\n“Ineke was a great opponent and it was a very tight match. I drove the ball really well, but my putting wasn’t so great and I had to really scramble at times. I’m so proud that I won, because this is my first win and it feels great. I enjoyed this week very much. GolfRSA and Royal Johannesburg did a great job and it was very cool to have both championships here together.”\r\n\r\n<i>Written and released by Lali Stander on behalf of GolfRSA.</i>",

    "articleText": "The thing about Central Florida winter weather that some people don't understand is that it can change in a heartbeat, dropping from shirts and shorts to freezing your you-know-what off in the span of a day.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThat's exactly what happened in Tampa at the Gasparilla Invitational, where the practice rounds and first round on Thursday saw temperatures in the low 80s before a major shift brought in winds and low the thermometer dropping to the low 50s. That brought out the sweaters, and caused the birdies to hide out (from the scorecards that is).<br><br>\r\n\r\nThursday, there were 16 scores in red-numbers. Today? Only three.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nOne of those scores, a 5-under 65 by <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/806/Derek-Busby?p=1\">Derek Busby,</a>, is even more amazing given that it tied the low round of the tournament and bested his first round 67 by two.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"Definitely tough conditions,\" said Busby in an exclusive phone interview with AmateurGolf.com.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd if you wonder if equipment makes a difference, think of what's important on a day like Friday, when control is key. Busby credited his new wedges with helping him make the key shots he needed in the 100 yard range. (And while we didn't get the brand he's playing, our detectives are on it for tomorrow - stay tuned.)<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I made some equipment changes in the offseason,\" explained Busby, \"most notably to my wedges I put in a lot of time getting the soles and bounces just right, this new setup has enabled me to have more shots from inside 100 yds and today that was the major difference.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nBusby is a proven winner with USGA experience. He <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/20397/Derek-Busby-goes-wire-to-wire-at-the-Crane-Cup\">won the 2017 Crane Cup</a> wire-to-wire. At The Floridian, Busby took at two stroke lead into the final round and closed the deal with a 69.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf he gets off to the kind of start tomorrow that he did today, it's going to be hard to catch the Ruston, Louisiana resident. His scorecard today? Eagle-birdie-birdie and a 31 on the front nine. And the first hole is a par four.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I hit a driver downwind to 50 yards, then played a nipping spinner lob wedge, (a shot I just learned how to play) that two-hopped into the hole,\" said Busby, before explaining his strategy going forward.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"When you get out to a fast start you want to make sure you continue to think well,\" said Busby of his round today. \"The conditions were so tough it forced me to continue to think and focus on every shot.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Gasparilla field has improved quite a bit in the past few years, and trailing Busby is the fifth ranked Mid-Amateur in the U.S. (and 2019 U.S. Mid-Am runner-up), <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/16012/Joseph-Deraney\">Joe Deraney</a> (68-69).

Jones stands at 2-under 138 while Kerper trails at 3-over 143 and Hanzel is tied with 2019 U.S. Senior Am champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/41146/Bob-Royak\">Bob Royak</a> at 144.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThere are 35 seniors in the field, and just over 100 mid-ams. The 54-hole tournament continues Friday, with the final round being played Saturday.<br><br>\r\n\r\nCould any of the chasers make things interesting? With weather dropping into the low 30s overnight in the Tampa Bay area, anything is possible. We know the sweaters and hand warmers will be out in the morning.",

    "teaser": "San Francisco native makes his dream of winning 'The City' a reality at TPC Harding Park just two months before the PGA visits",
    "articleText": "It was Charles in charge today at the San Francisco City Championship. <br><br>\r\n\r\nSan Francisco native Charles Porter -- who will turn 21 in March -- gave himself an early birthday present with a 7-and-5 victory over Domingo Jojola of Carmichael at TPC Harding Park, which will host the PGA Championship in May.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe left-handed Jojola, 33, hung tough in the morning match as Porter made up for missing fairways with his driver by holing several long par saving putts. The morning session turned in Porter's favor on No. 15. After bombing a drive into the rough short-siding his approach into the tucked-left flag, Porter chipped in for birdie to go 2-up. He then took advantage of Jojola's tee shot into the trees left on No. 18 with a steady par to take a 3-up lead into the afternoon.<br><br>\r\nIt was all Porter on the second 18, where a change in strategy off the tee made all the difference.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I had a game plan [in the afternoon] because he is such a good player that I wanted to hit fairways and give myself putts for birdie,\" said Porter. \"And it worked well.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nSo well, in fact, that after the 5th hole of the afternoon match, Porter was 5-up and seemingly out of reach. But back-to-back wins by Jojola kept things interesting until the par-3 8th hole, where Jojola got back to 4-up. From there, cruise-control set in with a final blow on the par-5 12th hole, where Porter hit his second shot to a closely-mown area over the green, then deftly pitched to four feet and made birdie while Jojola failed to get up-and-down from the bunker.<br><br>\r\n<div class=\"video-container\">\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/d4H1LeyH2zw\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n</div><br><br>\r\nThe match would end on No. 13, with Porter making a steady par to win 7-and-5. <br><br>\r\nAsked how much more fun watching the PGA might be in May, Porter smiled and joked, \"Can I get in?\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nMaybe some day. But for now it's back to Napa Valley College, where Porter is a member of the golf team.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>WOMEN'S DIVISION</b><br><BR>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float:right; padding: 5px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00060057.jpg\"><br><div align=\"center\">Emily Hou (Pete Wlodkowski photo)</div></div>Emily Hou, playing in her first City Championship, followed in the footsteps of Dougherty High School (San Ramon) teammate Danielle Suh, the 2019 Women's champion.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhile Suh lost in the first round, Hou, 15, went through opponent after opponent -- including an 8th grader Leigh Chien who gave her a tough test in the semi-finals -- before outlasting Andrea Gomez of Santa Clara in today's final match. <br><br>\r\n\r\n\"She was one of the first to text me after the match today,\" said Hou.<br><br>\r\n\r\nGomez played steady golf all day, often matching her younger opponent shot for shot as the two battled into the third nine of the 36-hole final. The turning point for Hou came on No. 10, when she was faced with an uphill third shot of 155 yards, while her opponent had just 100 yards in. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter launching a mid-iron to within 8 feet of the back-right hole location, Hou drained the putt with the pin in, as both she and her opponent did all day. Hou followed with another birdie on the par-3 11th, cashing in a solid pin-high tee shot with a 15-foot birdie putt. <br><br>\r\n\r\nShe stayed 3-up through No. 15 (when a three putt gave Gomez an opening) but closed the door on No. 16 after saving par from a tough lie in the penalty area on the left. After chopping out of some spinach, Hou deftly chipped to 4 feet and won the match 3-and-2 when Gomez missed her comeback par putt after charging for a birdie.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the Women's Inskter Flight, Aman Sangha won a close final match, defeating Mika Lin on the 19th hole.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>SENIOR, SUPER-SENIOR DIVISIONS</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nDefending champ Jim Knoll (Sunnyvale) took a commanding 4-up lead into the back nine in his scheduled 18-hole final match against Larry Salk and never looked back, winning the match 5-and-4. For the 67-year-old Knoll, known to California senior golfers for his informative tournament-related email updates, it was business as usual all day. Steady ball striking, finding fairways and greens and relying on the putter as necessary.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHis opponent had seen just about enough of Knoll's putting after it caught fire on the front nine.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I might give up one of my kids to putt like he did on the front nine,\" joked Salk as the duo walked up the 10th fairway.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHerb Jensen of Carmichael won the Super-Senior division over David Bosley of Fairfield, 2-and-1, while Soran Lim of Villa Park made her trip to northern California pay off with a close win over Kelly Simpson (Dublin) for the Women's Senior title, 1-up.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>OPEN FLIGHTS</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the Venturi Flight, Christian Quint defeated Ken Harrington in a tight match that ended on the 19th hole.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Susko Flight final also went to an extra hole, with Abi Vickram prevailing over Guillermo Barton.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFrederick Meiswinkel won the Archer Flight by a 3-and-2 margin over Enrico Diaz.<br><br>\r\n\r\nRod Kho won the Ward Flight, defeating Jay Chatfield 1up.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<B>TOURNAMENT NOTES</B><br><br>\r\n\r\nUntrue to form, San Francisco rain hardly played a part in the tournament after the driest February since 1864. But mother nature dished out plenty of wind during the tournament, enough to suspend matches at Lincoln Park in the middle of the month when limbs being knocked out of trees made being on the course dangerous.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSince its return to glory under the guidance of former USGA President Sandy Tatum, Harding Park has been a favorite of \"SF City\" players. But this year was better than ever, as the course is getting in major-ready condition with the PGA Championship coming in May. The fairways are half of their normal width.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately,\" noted tournament chairman Mike Miller, \"it's been a dry February so they have been able to mow the rough.\"",

Trevor did not\r\nsurprise us. He is very comfortable on courses like this. His game travels us. He carried us.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nWerbylo, a junior from Tucson, agreed with his coach about his comfort level.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“It is similar to our course in Arizona,” said Werbylo. “I think it might be new to some other teams to see desert\r\ngolf, but I felt comfortable. I liked the course today and yesterday, so I had confidence coming into today.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nBlake Wagoner of Arizona State trails Werbylo by one stroke after a 67<br><br>\r\n\r\n<u>Notable</u><br><br>\r\n\r\n- Seven of the 15 teams finished the first round under par despite the Cove Club being a new site for the\r\ntournament.<br><br>\r\n\r\n- Florida State’s John Pak started his round with a triple bogey seven but righted his game and was five-\r\nunder par with six birdies and a bogey in his next 17 holes to finish at 1-under 69.",

    "teaser": "The man who won the 1954 U.S. Amateur, 7 majors, and 62 PGA Tour events (and is known to golfers as the \"King\") has his own stamp",
    "articleText": "Wednesday, March 4 is a special day for golfers everywhere. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThat's because Wednesday is the day that Arnold Palmer will be recognized with a Forever First Class U.S. Postal Service stamp and a \"First Date of Issue\" ceremony at the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill Country Club in Orlando.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe only problem? <br><br>\r\n\r\nWell, as anyone who knows the slightest bit about golf history is aware, the golfer known as \"The King\" grew up and maintained a lifetime home in Latrobe, Pennsylvania.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThat rankled some longtime Latrobe golfers, who think the ceremony should have taken place there.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs a media company, we can certainly understand why the U.S. Postal Service chose Orlando --and Arnold Palmer's PGA tour event at Bay Hill -- as the place to do the ceremony.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAlthough Latrobe didn't land the \"First Date of Issue\" ceremony, residents and visitors won't have any problem getting the stamps on March 4. The Latrobe post office ordered a whopping 80,000 of them to stock up.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn an age when many young people never even buy stamps, getting maximum media exposure makes sense. And Orlando was Palmer's second home, and the city where he co-founded The Golf Channel. But don't tell that to Latrobe native Fran Brasile, who once worked at Palmer's Latrobe Country Club.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn an interview with Jim Himler of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, Brasile said:<br><br>\r\n\r\n“It should be here. Latrobe is where he grew up.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nBrasile, 55, described the golfing legend to Himler as a strict boss who demanded respect from employees. But he also noted that Palmer’s rapport with his fans was unmatched in the sport.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“He’d never shun the fans,” Brasile said. “He would shake your hand and sign everybody’s autograph. He’d spend hours.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nI can attest to the unique quality that Arnold Palmer had to seemingly make eye contact with everyone in the gallery as he stood waiting to tee off, or passed through an aisle from green to tee. I experienced that feeling on more than one occasion, including one of his last Masters tournaments, standing on the 2nd tee at Augusta National.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs a 14-year-old, I wrote a letter and simply mailed it simply to \"Arnold Palmer, Latrobe, Pennsylvania.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nI asked Mr. Palmer if he would return to my home state of Connecticut to play in the Greater Hartford Open that year. It was the site of his first U.S. PGA Tour victory -- his official first win was in Canada -- but he hadn't returned to play in years.<br><br>\r\n\r\nI received a reply that spring, (dated on my birthday of all dates) indicating that he would return in 1976, and that he looked forward to the possibility of meeting me. Sure, it may have been drafted by his secretary, but the signature was his, and it was real. <br><br>\r\n\r\nI would wind up working the tournament and acting as standard bearer for Palmer's group one of the rounds. I didn't bother him during play. But on the 17th tee, on a 95 degree humid day, I saw him reach into a large ice bucket full of towels. As his Popeye-sized forearms twisted the water out of one of the towels, I witnessed his strength with boyhood admiration. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThen, as he walked towards me, I realized the towel was for me.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"You look really hot,\" he said as he handed me the towel. \"Wrap this around your neck, it will cool you off.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs I have recalled that moment many times over the years to my golfing buddies, it seems everyone has an Arnold Palmer story to relate. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd regarding Palmer's hometown, I'm hoping that Latrobe will get a ceremony of its own at a later date. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Tribune-Review story said:<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"There is talk of a special cancellation mark featuring an image of Palmer’s signature and his trademark umbrella logo, but it won’t be available Wednesday at the Latrobe post office, according to Jill Walters, a spokeswoman for the service’s Western Pennsylvania District. She said details for any future “postmark events” have yet to be confirmed.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nI don't know about you, but my stamps have been pre-ordered. Enough to last a long time. Because there is nothing like a personal letter, like the congratulatory ones that Arnold Palmer used to send to PGA Tour winners. If you get one from me, it's going to have one of his stamps on it -- until I run out that is.<br><br>\r\n\r\nYou can order them from the USPS, in sheets of 20 for $11.00, by <a href=\"https://store.usps.com/store/product/buy-stamps/arnold-palmer-S_475904\" target=\"_blank\">clicking here.</a>",

Both teams will bring seven players. Five head-to-head\r\nmatches will be played, and the remaining two players on each team will be available to come\r\noff the bench in certain situations to hit a shot for a teammate.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAn additional wrinkle is the Coach’s Challenge: Each coach – Stanford’s Conrad Ray and Illinois’\r\nMike Small – can at any point during a match toss out a challenge flag, thereby challenging the\r\nopposing coach to step in and hit the shot his player is about to play.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAll five matches will be live-streamed here on AmateurGolf.com. Each match will be captured by a single\r\nwalking camera. Both coaches will accompany the opening match, and all players and coaches\r\nwill be mic’ed throughout the stream.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“We’re big supporters of college golf, and this is an opportunity to try something new with two\r\nof the best collegiate teams in the nation,” said Jeff Neubarth, Callaway Director of Content &\r\nProduction. “That’s why we created this challenge to give fans complete inside-the-ropes\r\naccess from start to finish, and to do it in a way that is authentic, engaging, and fun for the fans\r\nwho live stream it.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nEstablished in 1965, Rolling Hills Country Club features a championship golf course designed by\r\nworld-renowned golf course architect David McClay Kidd, best known for designing Bandon\r\nDunes, the first course opened at Bandon Dunes Golf Resort; and a 70,000 sq. ft. clubhouse\r\ndesigned by celebrated clubhouse architect Robert Altevers. Rolling Hills hosted the 2018 Men’s\r\nPAC-12 Men’s Golf Championships.",

Rivera, from Rancho Santa Fe, California,  is coming off a win just a few weeks ago at the Rancho Santa Margarita Amateur after surviving a late afternoon sudden-death playoff.  Conditions were excellent for scoring at Black Gold Golf Club with Rivera rolling in six birdies en route to his 69. Sitting just one shot behind Rivera in a tie for second at 2-under are Dean Netzel, Jack Solis, and Raymond Kim.  \r\n\r\nIn the Senior Championship Division, Jeff Peterson has a three-shot lead despite an unfortunate double-bogey on the final hole. Peterson shot a 3-over-par 75 and with Anthony Ventura and Ron Kaehn both sitting at 6-over-par.",

Blair’s birdie attempt blasted by the hole and ended up outside of Kim’s mark.  His comeback putt failed to touch the hole, leaving Kim a 4-foot putt to wrap up the victory.  <div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/ii8cAryk6je5dbZK9A/giphy.gif\"></div>\r\n\r\n“I don’t smile,” Kim said as he was handed the championship trophy.\r\n\r\nFirst-round leader Jackson Rivera finished with a disappointing bogey on the last hole to miss out on the playoff.

    "teaser": "The Stanford commit and 2018 U.S. Junior champ shows no signs of rust in his first round of the year",
    "articleText": "Michael Thorbjornsen of Wellesley, Massachusetts, had no trouble shaking off the rust at the 10th Junior Invitational at Sage Valley Golf Club, finishing at 5-under-par in what was his first round of competitive golf in 2020.\r\n\r\nWhile the tournament will continue as planned, a restrictive on-site attendance policy will take effect beginning with the second round tomorrow (Friday) March 13. The only people allowed on the property will be players, their family and essential personnel.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThis marks Thorbjornsen’s third and final appearance in the Junior Invitational, as he heads to Stanford this fall. The 18-year-old 2018 U.S. Junior Amateur champion carded four birdies on the front nine, including an impressive 20-footer on Hole No. 5 that kick started his birdie streak.\r\n\r\n“I haven’t really been putting as much indoors as I would like, and it’s my first time playing golf since December,” he said. “I’m not even sure December would count because it was a team event. My last tournament was in August.”\r\n\r\nThat lack of playing time didn’t seem to have an effect on him. But it was ball striking, not putting, that Thorbjornsen identified as his strength in round one.\r\n\r\n“I think I hit every single green except for two of them,” he said. “I really set myself up well, and I’ve gained some distance over this off season. I took the longest club I had into a par-4 today, a soft 9-iron, and I think compared to last season I was hitting a 6-iron which made a big difference.”\r\n\r\nFellow American Luke Potter, 16, of Encinitas, California, sits in second just behind Thorbjornsen at 4-under-par. The Arizona State University verbal commit recently set a 54-hole AJGA tournament record with a score of 20-under-par 196 at the AJGA Simplify Boys Championship at Carlton Woods last month.\r\n\r\n“My game has improved dramatically,” he said, remarking on his second time competing in the Junior Invitational. “It always helps to have played the course, and I took some notes last year and made some adjustments to shots today.”\r\n\r\nThe second round will continue tomorrow (Friday) March 13, with tee times beginning at 9 a.m. ET. Defending champion Tom McKibbin of Northern Ireland finished T43 at 5-over-par for the day. Junior Invitational veteran Karl Vilips of Australia withdrew following the first round because of a prior finger injury.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nIn Monday night’s opening ceremonies, the SVGI Sports Foundation announced the addition of a girls competition beginning with the 2021 Junior Invitational. LPGA Tour stars Lexi Thompson and Lorie Kane attended in support of the announcement.\r\n\r\nAlso during opening ceremonies, 16-year-old Gordon Sargent was presented with the 2020 Paul S. Simon Character Award, which honors a Junior Invitational player for his accomplishments both on and off the course. The Birmingham native co-created the Alabama Cup in 2018 hosted at Shoal Creek to benefit Children's Harbor, the American Cancer Society Alabama Chapter and the AJGA’s ACE Grant program. The inaugural event raised nearly $60,000 for these charities.",

He played the front nine in the afternoon at even par.\r\n\r\n <br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n“To get the whole day started with that birdie created a lot of confidence with my putter, which is a big thing for me,” he added. “I made probably five or six putts between four and seven feet for par, and I think at a course like Sage Valley, making your par putts is huge.”\r\n\r\n <br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\nChina’s Aaron Du, 18, is making a splash in his first appearance at the Junior Invitational, sitting in second place behind Moldovan at 7-under for the tournament.

It’s one of the best feelings in the world. We don’t know when our next tournament’s going to be so to end with a win is a great feeling.”\r\n\r\n <br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe 2019 AJGA Simplify Boys Championship winner and verbal Vanderbilt University commit birdied Hole Nos. 4, 5 and 6, which he followed up with a much-needed 12-foot par putt on No. 7 and topped it off with another birdie on No. 8.\r\n\r\n <br><br>\r\n\r\n“I tried to stay patient,” said Van Paris. “With it only being nine holes, it’s really easy to go out there and try to force birdies. I told my caddie, ‘I was even through three on the nine. Just got to stay patient, let the birdies come.’ Thankfully, my putter got hot and I started making some birdies.”\r\n\r\n <br><br>\r\n\r\nFellow 16-year-old Luke Potter of Encinitas, California, claimed the runner-up spot, finishing two strokes back at 7-under with a combined 209 (68-71-70).\r\n\r\n <br><br>\r\n\r\n“I was a ways back going into these last nine holes, so I tried to stay aggressive and give myself as many birdie chances as possible,” said Potter. “I had a lot of fun this year.”\r\n\r\n <br><br>\r\n\r\nMcKibbin, who finished T27 at 3-over 219 (77-69-73), passed the torch and coveted Golden Jacket to Van Paris today.\r\n\r\n <br><br>\r\n\r\n“I would’ve liked to win it again this year, but I couldn’t be happier that it went to him,” said McKibbin. “He was the first person I played with from the U.S. in my first tournament over here, so I think it’s pretty cool.”\r\n\r\n <br><br>\r\n\r\nThree players finished tied for third, including 2019 Junior Invitational runner-up Maxwell Moldovan, 18, of Union Town, Ohio (70-65-75, 210); 18-year-old Tyler Wilkes of Tampa, Florida (72-67-71, 210); and 18-year-old Michael Brennan of Leesburg, Virginia (73-71-66, 210).\r\n\r\n        <br><br>                                                                                              \r\n\r\nTwo high-profile withdrawals from the Junior Invitational were results of previous injuries.

She is the second female to ever win the Eileen Dawson Stroke play and Amateur Championship titles, but the first to break a course record during her win.\r\n\r\nRoyal Fremantle’s Hayden Hopewell was victorious on the 36th hole winning the match 1UP after a see-sawing tussle against Mount Lawley’s Jordan Jung.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe Sir Charles Gairdner trophy was awarded to number one seed Haydn Barron, narrowly winning the stroke play element over Hopewell by one.\r\n\r\nRudgely defeated state teammate and great friend Kathryn Norris 3&2 in the 36-hole match play final.\r\n\r\nSpeaking after her victory, Rudgeley said, “Kat and I both played well I guess. On the first nine, I got on a roll and had four birdies in a row which pushed me out in front. But Kat came back strong in the next 18. I putted around the hole really well when I needed to, and I managed to do the right things at the right time to keep me in the game.”\r\n\r\n“My game has changed since my win last year. I feel stronger, more confident and making the distance. The parts of my game I have been working on seem to be coming together. I never used to be able to make birdies like I can now.”\r\n\r\n“Huge thanks to all the supporters and especially Mum and Dad, and Ben for coming out. Thank you Kathryn for a great game and Melville GladesGolf Club for sharing their course.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nJung and Hopewell were very evenly matched with Jung leading for the majority of the round. Coming up the 36th hole square, Hopewell managed an approach shot three foot from the hole.\r\n\r\n“I was thrilled and relieved I managed that sixty metre shot into the pin. Jungy was in the greenside trap and unfortunately thinned his shot out into the bunker on the other side. To be left with a three-footer for the win was very exciting.”\r\n\r\n“My sister was awesome on the bag and really thankful for her caddying for me in such a long tournament. It was a long week. My golf was A1 at the start of the week but fatigue does play a part in this tournament. Today’s 36 hole final was a rollercoaster, Jungy looked very solid from the start. I hit some really nice approach shots to stay in the game. I was three down with eleven to play. I told myself to stay patient, get a couple of birdies I could change the flow. Eventually, I did on the last hole.”\r\n\r\n“Huge thanks to the Royal Freo supporters and team Hopewell. I am thrilled to win this after participating many times.”",

A tee shot leaked into the right tree’s didn’t make the leader panic; he hit yet another quality shot under pressure to find the green and would two putt for victory.\r\n\r\nHe is ecstatic to get his first national championship over the line.\r\n\r\n“I stood on the 18th tee and I thought, let’s just make bogey,” Lee laughs.\r\n\r\n“I managed to make a par, and this feels amazing. I played incredibly well and recovered after a bad start on the front nine, but I managed to make birdies when it really mattered down the stretch.\r\n\r\n“I honestly just feel so amazing right now,” he says.\r\n\r\nLee was able to compose himself after a slow start today, and credits last weeks close runner-up finish at the Super 6’s event on the Jennian Homes Charles Tour as a key learning experience to get the job done today.\r\n\r\n“I just focused on my own game for the whole day today. I just wanted to shoot somewhere around two-under, and I thought that would get me somewhere around the lead. It seemed to work today.\r\n\r\n“I finally did it,” he cheers.\r\n\r\nLee carded round of 71, 69, 65, and 69 to win three over Kobori who finished in second place.\r\n\r\nEqual course record holder Charlie Smail wrapped up the bronze medal at 10-under, one shot ahead of Edwards.\r\n\r\nThe New Zealand Strokeplay will take place at Paraparaumu Beach Golf Club in 2021.",

Players rule sheets, scorecards, pin sheets, and tee gifts will be placed in carts.  Carts will be spread out to keep players a safe distance away from each other. All carts will be sanitized before each round for the protection of our players.<br><br>\r\n\r\nLunch each day will be served outside and packaged to take with you on the course as you pass by the clubhouse.

Tournament organizers are hopeful that the tournament will be played, but are guarded and ever-watchful of developments.\r\n\r\nThe message on the Sunnehanna website reflects that duality:\r\n\r\n\"Presently we have every intention of playing this year’s Sunnehanna Amateur. We will continue to monitor the recommendations of public health officials and government. We have several months to make a decision if we would need to cancel. In the meantime, please be safe, look after yourselves, your family, friends and community. For everyone’s sake, let’s hope we are in a far better place in a few weeks.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same interview with the Tribune-Democrat, Yerger noted that with the tournament being held during U.S. Open week (June 18-21), the fate of the Sunnehanna is tied to what the USGA decides.\r\n\r\nThere is still plenty of time to make a decision on whether to go forward, but regardless of what happens, Yerger says that the focus should be on \"the right now\".\r\n\r\nAgain from the interview:\r\n\r\n\"Everyone’s focus should be on being good neighbors, good friends, good children, good fathers and mothers and looking after each other. That’s what this is about right now.\"",

Golf Club.\r\n\r\nThe 27-year-old Terry rolled in a 15-foot birdie putt on he final hole that proved to be the winner.\r\n\r\nTerry, a financial consultant and former Tennessee Mid-Amateur champion, was the only player in the field to break par all three rounds, with rounds of 69-66-69 for a 6-under-par 204 total.\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/22001/Terry-wins-Tennessee-Mid-Am--Jackson-second\">Terry wins Tennessee Mid-Am; Jackson second</a>\r\n\r\nAnother mid-amateur, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/27305/Steve-Albright?p=1\">Steve Albright</a> (Ocala, Fla.), made a big charge on the final day with a 7-under 63, which was the low rounds of the tournament by three shots.

    "articleText": "<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/19645/John-Pak?p=1\">John Pak</a>'s trajectory of improvement was one born of sacrifice.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Scotch Plains, N.J. native left his family after his freshman year of high school to move to Orlando, Fla. and focus on golf while being home-schooled. It was a difficult decision and a tough transition, but Pak's single-minded focus and drive propelled him forward.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe accolades soon followed: A Rolex Junior First Team All-America selection, a scholarship and a place on the Florida State (FSU) golf team, ACC freshman-of-the-year honors, an FSU single-year scoring average record, First-Team All-America honors, a Walker Cup selection, and an appearance on just about every major college golf award watch list.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHis seven collegiate tournament wins include the 2019 ACC Championship, and have put him just one win away from equaling the FSU record.

He also made the final 16 in both the U.S. and Western Amateur championships.<br><br>\r\n\r\nPak's run has seen him rise to No. 2 in the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-rankings/golfweek-agc-men\">Golfweek/AmateurGolf.com World Amateur Ranking</a>, and as the spring season progressed, he seemed perfectly poised to make a run to the logical conclusion of his trajectory -- an NCAA Championship, a major amateur win, a No. 1 ranking.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut now everything has stopped.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has reached pandemic proportions and disrupted practically every aspect of life, grinding many activities to a halt for the foreseeable future.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26004/List-of-amateur-tournaments-affected-by-the-coronavirus-outbreak\">List of amateur tournaments affected by the coronavirus outbreak</a><br><br>\r\n\r\nFor Pak and college golfers everywhere, this meant a sudden and unexpected end to the season. The goals that players and teams were pursuing all year, not to mention the comfort of daily routines, were taken away from everyone. Uncertainty remains, as the transition is made to online schooling and no one can be sure when their next big tournament will be.<br><br>\r\n\r\nPak will no doubt rely on the same focus and drive to weather this difficult transition, and be ready when the opportunity arises to compete again.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAmateurGolf.com's Shawn Allen spoke with John Pak about the growth of his game, his lost season, and how he is staying sharp during the lockdown. The interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"contentTitle\">Interview with John Pak</div><br>\r\n\r\n<b>What was it like to hear the news that your season was cancelled?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nIt was sort of crazy. We were playing golf together as a team, and we were supposed to leave for one of the best tournaments of the year at the Floridian, the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/7530/Valspar-Collegiate-Invitational\">Valspar Collegiate</a>, and we hear all the news. We hear that the tournament is going to get cancelled. Then we hear that this [other tournament] is getting cancelled, that [other tournament] is getting cancelled. It's pretty sad because a senior on our team, Jamie Li, was having a good season and...I just don't think we're done yet. It was really a shock to all of us.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>With the season over, how are you able to practice? Can you utilize the FSU coaching or facilities?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nI've just been doing my own thing. It's a little boring out here right now. I still have to work on my game to get better but I'm doing things on my own now.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Are you able to play in the new facility (the Seminole Legacy Club)?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe course is still open, we're still playing it. A few of my teammates are still here so maybe we'll have a match or something, but we're not allowed to have team practices so I'm kind of just doing my own thing.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00060239.jpg\" alt=\"John Pak at the Seminole Intercollegiate\"><span id=\"ContentPlaceHolder1_labArticleImageCaption\" class=\"caption\"><br/>John Pak at the Seminole Intercollegiate (Gary Putnik/FSView photo)<br/><br/></span></div>\r\n\r\n<b>You were trending in the right direction like just you were in 2019, and you just won your <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/5193/Seminole-Intercollegiate\">Seminole Intercollegiate</a>. What went your way that led to your victory?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nI just felt very confident in my game and mentally I've been very strong this year and I think that's what has helped in my success so far. My game hasn't changed much since freshman year but my mentality definitely has.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>How has your mentality changed?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nBack in junior golf, I had never won an invitational, never won a big tournament. And I got to college and I won my first event in my freshman year. Then in my sophomore year I won four times. When you know you can win, it just frees the mind up. In the back of my mind, I always know I can win because I've done it, and in junior golf that wasn't the case, and that's what made me mentally tougher.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n<b>How have your coaches helped you with your mental game?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nMy coaches definitely help a lot because they know my game very well and they're very positive about my swing, my putting, and they give me a lot of confidence. Also, Dr. Bhrett McCabe, a mental coach, comes in to help us once a year. He loves that competitive drive I have, and he tells me to use it to my fullest advantage, and I think that's what I do.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>When you are on the course, are you thinking about your swing or your putting? Or are you thinking about how to attack the course?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen I'm playing my best, I am not thinking about my swing. I'm thinking about where the ball is going to end up, where I want to hit it. People don't realize this but there is a lot of strategy to it. You've got to play to your strengths and that's my main focus while I'm on the golf course.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>How would you describe your strengths?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nMy overall game is very solid. Nothing is really really good and nothing is really really bad. My misses are always very small so I don't make a lot of big numbers. I am very consistent.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Do you have a preferred shot shape?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nI love hitting a draw. If the ball is going left-to-right, especially off the tee, it's not a good day for me!<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00060237.jpg\" alt=\"John Pak\"><span id=\"ContentPlaceHolder1_labArticleImageCaption\" class=\"caption\"><br/><br/></span></div>\r\n\r\n<b>What is your favorite club to hit?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nDefinitely my 8-iron. It's what I do all my drills with, and there's a big wear mark on it. I love hitting that club.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>What does a practice session look like for you?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nNormally I do my stretch, do a couple of drills, hit some balls, putt and chip a little bit, and maybe play nine holes. Then maybe do some more practicing. That's a typical day for me.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Last year as a sophomore, you had four wins and top-ten finishes in just about every tournament. Your worst finish, however, was at the NCAA Regionals (a tie for 35th). What happened that week?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nI think I put a little too much pressure on myself. I thought we had a good team and we had a chance to make a good (NCAA Championship) run but that pressure kind of got to me. I was forcing things a lot, and I wasn't hitting it my best. I let my head get to me a little bit. Just the atmosphere of \"top 5 or go home\" was a lot of pressure and that's what kept me from having a good tournament.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<i>Editor's note: only the top five teams advance from each regional to the NCAA Championship.</i><br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>You rebounded to have a great summer, including high finishes in the Western Amateur and U.S. Amateur, then a Walker Cup win. What was that run like for you?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nI don't know what it was, my game just clicked and I was playing some of the best golf of my life. The U.S. Amateur at Pinehurst was an incredible experience -- by far the toughest golf course I've ever played. The Walker Cup was also an amazing experience. To play with nine of the best amateur golfers from the United States, and to play against the top ten from Great Britain and Ireland, there's no experience like it. You've got 20 guys on one golf course playing for their countries and it was so awesome.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>You won three of four matches at the Walker Cup including one with a putt on the final hole (against British Amateur champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18508/James-Sugrue?p=1\">James Sugrue</a> of Ireland). What is it like to win a match on your last stroke?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nI was more nervous on the first tee ball -- that was nerve wracking -- but there were probably 500 people around the green, and I had an eight-footer for birdie to win. My heart was <i>racing</i> and I made the [putt] and that is something that I will never ever forget.<br><br>\r\n\r\nEarlier in that match, I was one down with two to play and I won 17. On 18, it was not really a driver hole, but I had the honor and I hit driver and put some pressure on him. He ended up hitting driver as well but he hit it right. I hit it to about eight feet, he hit it over the green, then chipped it to two feet. I had a putt to win, it dropped, and that's something I'll always remember.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00060236.jpg\" alt=\"John Pak at the Walker Cup\"><span id=\"ContentPlaceHolder1_labArticleImageCaption\" class=\"caption\"><br/>John Pak after making the winning putt against James Sugrue at the Walker Cup (Golf Digest Ireland photo)<br/><br/></span></div>\r\n\r\n<b>You are from New Jersey but you left home to spend your last three years of high school home-schooling in Orlando. Was that a hard decision to make and how was the transition?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nIt was very tough. I didn't really like the whole idea too much but my parents wanted me to do it and convinced me to do it. I didn't enjoy it too much but it definitely made my golf game way better. I wouldn't be here if I didn't make that move, I genuinely believe that.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut it was really tough. I lived [in Orlando] with my dad and my dad only. I have three older brothers and a sister, all in New Jersey, and my mom lives up in New Jersey so it was tough moving away from the family. But I made a lot of good friends and a lot of great connections in Orlando, and I think it definitely worked out.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Where did you train?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nI worked with Sean Hogan at <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-courses/FL/Davenport/16052/ChampionsGate-Golf-Resort\">ChampionsGate</a> -- he's a David Leadbetter guy -- and I practiced at <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-courses/FL/Orlando/18907/Orange-Tree-Golf-Club\">Orange Tree Golf Club</a>.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>What was the biggest cultural difference between Orlando and New Jersey?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nI can't say a whole lot because I was home-schooled. I only went to the golf course, the gym and... I only went to like four locations when I was in Orlando, so there wasn't a whole lot to see of the cultural aspect of Orlando.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>You won the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/5332/Atlantic-Coast-Conference-Men-s-Golf-Championship\">ACC Championship</a> as an individual last year, and on your bio you said it was your greatest golfing accomplishment. Why is that?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nI think it's the biggest tournament I ever won. The ACC is a very strong conference. We've got Georgia Tech, Wake Forest, Duke, Clemson -- a lot of great golf schools. There are always arguments about which conference is the best, and I might be a little biased, but I think ours is. To compete against those guys and to beat them in the conference championship...

I want them to know that I've got their backs as well, to stay four years. Also, the top five seniors [in the NCAA] will now get Korn Ferry Tour status. I don't know how that's going to work now [with the NCAA allowing current seniors to have one more year of eligibility because of coronavirus ending the season], but one thing's for sure and that is that I've wanted to stay here for four years and I definitely will. The bottom line is I love it here.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"contentTitle\">Lightning Round</div><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Favorite place to eat in Tallahassee?</b> Gordo's. I probably go more than once a week. I get a Cuban with fries and Gordo sauce. That Gordo sauce, I don't know what's in that, but it's addictive.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Favorite golf drill?</b> I like doing mirror work. We have a mirror set up in our hitting bay. I have three key positions and I do that before every single practice session, or try to.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Course you've most enjoyed?</b> Such a tough one. I had the most fun at Royal Liverpool where we had the Walker Cup. I don't think it's the best course [I've played] but I had the most fun out there.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>What's in the bag?</b> I am all TaylorMade. I have the Sim driver, M6 3-wood, and a UDI 2-iron which is like five or six years old now. I have 750s from my 4-iron to my 9-iron. My putter is a TP Berwick and I've got to be honest, I don't know what the wedges are called, but the latest TaylorMade wedges.<br><br>\r\n\r\nI've been using the same type of [mallet-style] putter for about eight years. Some people [switch around] and it works for them. My teammate Jamie Li, one of the best putters I've ever seen, changes it up all the time. But he always goes back to that one special one.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Favorite college golf tournament?</b> The <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/7528/Cabo-Collegiate\">Cabo Collegiate</a> is my favorite tournament. B.A. Kline is the tournament host and she does an awesome job. She makes everyone feel welcome. I love the food there. The first day we got there, for breakfast I had 12 tacos. I just ate way too much but I loved it. We get to stay with host families and they are always so good to me.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAnother one is our home tournament (the Seminole Intercollegiate). My friends come out and my family comes out. They are two different kinds of fun I guess. I like them both.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Favorite amateur golf tournament?</b> The Walker Cup. It's completely different. When you have <i>that</i> much on the line, it's pretty amazing.",

    "articleText": "Once the last tee times on March 25 go out, Bandon Dunes Resort will close all five courses until April 6. The move follows a March 23 executive order from Oregon Governor Kate Brown ordering Oregonians to stay at home with the usual exceptions for essential trips to grocery stores or health care providers.\r\n\r\nThe town of Bandon has issued an even stronger order, closing all hotels to \"transients\" staying less than 30 days due to an influx of visitors from Portland and other areas seeking shelter along the coast. While Bandon Dunes Resort is not subject to the Bandon ordinance due to its location outside of town, they are proceeding with an abundance of caution.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nI've been running the AmateurGolf.com Two Man Links Championship for 18 years, with the 19th annual event scheduled for April 23-27. We have not cancelled the event yet, after polling each player by phone individually. Many of them drive to the tournament, and wish to proceed even with a smaller field. The resort has been gracious about offering full refunds for anyone that doesn't want to travel during this crisis.\r\n\r\nI'm fortunate to have close contact with Bandon Dunes on a daily basis, as the longest-running continually-held amateur tournament at the resort. For the last two weeks, they have been operating on with new guidelines, closing all restaurants and bars and offering a limited to-go menu for golfers to consume in their rooms. \r\n\r\nGeneral Manager Don Crowe told John Gunther of \"The World\" that golfers were grateful that Bandon was staying open.\r\n\r\n\"We're hearing positive feedback from guests who are thankful we are open,\" said Crowe. They appreciate the fact that we have taken such serious precautions to protect them in this situation.\"\r\n\r\nI continue to believe that golf, played with social distancing precautions like not touching the flagstick -- who knew the USGA's new rule would come in handy this way -- is a tremendously beneficial and safe way to keep our sanity during these difficult times. The problem isn't being on the course so much as getting there, especially for those that come to a resort like Bandon Dunes by plane. Not only is the travel portion risky, the potential to spread the virus to other places isn't necessarily prudent.\r\n\r\nSo I'm sure that Bandon will follow the state and federal government's guidelines and recommendations before re-opening. AmateurGolf.com will be watching closely, and will communicate any changes with our tournament players. \r\n\r\nClosing for the first time in 21 years is evidence that Bandon Dunes doesn't take the situation lightly. I have full confidence in the resort and it's staff to provide us with the best service possible when they do reopen, even if that means a grab-and-go breakfast before hitting the links. It wouldn't be the first time we hit the first tee with an egg sandwich in one hand and a driver in the other.",

    "title": "Tournament Talk: U.S. Amateur champion Andy Ogletree",
    "teaser": "The national champ and Georgia Tech senior has seen his plans, including playing the Masters with Tiger, thrown up into the air",
    "articleText": "\"You always have to have a plan.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis one motto perfectly captures both why <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/76098/Andy-Ogletree\">Andy Ogletree</a> was able to make his way from tiny Little Rock, Mississippi to the top of the amateur golf world as U.S. Amateur champion; but also why his life has been so upended by the continuing coronavirus pandemic that has thrown everything -- including the best-laid plans -- up in the air.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt's hard to have a plan when virtually nothing in the future is certain. Ogletree's plan was to make a run with his No. 3 ranked Georgia Tech teammates to an NCAA championship. But with the college season coming to a sudden halt, his college career is over.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe plan was to play in the Masters (paired with Tiger Woods), the U.S. Open, and the British Open, all of which offered exemptions to Ogletree as the U.S. Amateur champion. But the Masters has been postponed, and the U.S. Open, to be played near the current coronavirus hotspot in the U.S., is in jeopardy.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFinally, the plan included getting enough starts to gain status on the PGA Tour, but no one knows when the tour will resume or what the schedule might look like.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSo for Ogletree, the past is much clearer than the present or the future. It is easy to see how he came to this point; a <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25026/Mission-Accomplished--Ogletree-claims-Monroe-title-in-4th-try\">win at the Monroe Invitational</a> (like Pinehurst a Donald Ross classic) and a final 16 finish at the North & South Amateur (at Pinehurst) previewed the form and provided the experience that would fuel his <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25440/Ogletree-holds-off-Augenstein-to-win-U-S--Amateur\"> run to the U.S. Amateur title at Pinehurst</a>. Then came <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25538/Victory-abroad--Americans-win-Walker-Cup-with-Sunday-surge\">success at the Walker Cup</a>, a promising senior season at Georgia Tech, and what was a well-laid-out plan for the immediate future.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs a part of our Tournament Talk series, AmateurGolf.com founder Pete Wlodkowski spoke with Ogletree, who clearly is still trying to come to terms with the new reality, and is holding on to one of the few things he can control: his golf game.<br><br>\r\n\r\nYou can listen below (or on <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/amateurgolf/us-amateur-champion-andy-ogletree\" target=\"_blank\">SoundCloud</a> or <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tournament-talk-by-amateurgolf-com/id1486454876\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a>), or read the transcript highlights below (which have been edited for clarity and length).<br><br>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"330\" height=\"330\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/784032802&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true\"></iframe><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"contentTitle\">Interview with Andy Ogletree</div><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Where were you when you found out that your season, and your school year, were cancelled?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nWe were at our Georgia Tech practice facility...and our assistant coach got a phone call...saying that all NCAA championships have been cancelled for the spring semester. Shortly after that we got a text from Coach Heppler saying \"everyone come to the practice facility; we're going to have a team meeting\"...and he told us that he thinks that everything will eventually get cancelled.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWe were getting ready to leave the next day for a tournament, everybody was feeling pretty good, and we had a really good team: three seniors, a junior and a sophomore that have all played really well. And we were trending in the right direction; it was going to be a really good spring.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00060252.jpg\" alt=\"Georgia Tech men's golf team\"><span id=\"ContentPlaceHolder1_labArticleImageCaption\" class=\"caption\"><br/>Ogletree (center) and the Yellow Jackets won the Puerto Rico Classic in February (Georgia Tech photo)<br/><br/></span></div>\r\n\r\nBut the news hit us pretty hard. You come here to try to play in a national championship and try to win and we thought this was a really good chance for us and we really felt confident about where we were heading this year. And that's kind of taken away now, so I've had a little time to reflect now and the more it sets in the worse feeling it leaves.<br><br>\r\n\r\nRight now I don't know many answers. We're just trying to learn as much as we can and stay as positive as we can. We still have a few guys that have hung around Atlanta so we're still hanging out and practicing together. Everything practice-wise is still kind of normal. There are a few courses that are shut down and living conditions are a little different, but we're still able to practice and we're still able to have that team bonding that we've always had.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>It sounds like you're seeking respite in golf, which is good, but you don't have anything to prepare for immediately; your life was turned around.</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nExactly, we're preparing for the unknown. We don't really know what we're preparing for.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n<b>But you have a lot to prepare for because, if the U.S. Open ends up getting played, you're exempt. The Masters is going to get postponed and hopefully get played later in the year. And you're also exempt into the (British) Open Championship. What does that do to your plans to potentially turn professional or to even to potentially return (to Georgia Tech), as your eligibility could be extended according to the NCAA's recent decision? Have you made any of those decisions yet?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nObviously my mind is racing. I'm trying to talk to a lot of people to get a lot of answers but honestly no one really knows when the PGA Tour season is going to start back up. There's no one who knows for sure if the U.S. Open is going to be played. There's no one who knows for sure if the British Open is going to be played. Because no one knows when the tournaments are even going to start back.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSo yeah, I have a lot of stuff to look forward to <i>if</i> it all goes as planned and everything stays on schedule but for now I'm not going to get my hopes up on making a plan or getting a schedule because right now there's too much unknown. Whenever that day comes, when golf is back to normal, I'm going to be ready. That's the outlook I've had on it. Whether that be professional tournaments or amateur tournaments, I want my golf game to be in the same place. So it doesn't really matter to me, I'm just ready to play golf tournaments again.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00060246.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Ogletree tees off in the 2019 U.S. Amateur final\"><span id=\"ContentPlaceHolder1_labArticleImageCaption\" class=\"caption\"><br/>Andy Ogletree tees off in the 2019 U.S. Amateur final (USGA/Chris Keane photo)<br/><br/></span></div>\r\n\r\n<b>Sounds like the attitude of a U.S. Amateur champion! Whatever you decide to do, I'm sure you're going to have a chance to do it, but it was all made possible by winning the U.S. Amateur. So let's take a step back to August of 2019, you're four down after five holes against a fine player (<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18421/John-Augenstein?p=1\">John Augenstein</a>). You had seen some tweets that said that maybe he deserved to be there and wasn't sure if you deserved to be there. It sounds like you got a little bit of motivation from that.</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe night before I saw some tweets that only one of the players has the credibility to his name, and stuff like that, and that doesn't sit well with me. I'm a competitor; I'm a competitive guy. I always have been. And winning a golf tournament has been the priority of what I do forever. So that didn't sit well with me and I was just focused on winning the golf tournament.<br><br>\r\n\r\nI wasn't worried about the first four holes, the first ten holes, I knew it was going to be a long day. John is a great player and 36 holes is a lot of golf. Whoever plays the best over the 36 holes is going to win the match. I've been asked a lot about being four down through five and I keep telling everyone I never thought I was going to lose. I kept telling myself 36 holes is a lot of golf and let's focus on one shot at a time and if it's good enough at the end it's good enough. If not I'll be fine with it because I tried my hardest.<br><br>\r\n\r\nI think I won four of the last seven holes so people could say \"What about winning four of the last seven holes?\" but they didn't. They said \"How did it feel being four down through five?\" There are different runs like that in match play. It doesn't matter if it's early in the round or late in the round, over the course of the day it just matters what's on the scoreboard. So I really felt like I stayed one shot at a time, one hole at a time, and never beat myself.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Famateurgolf%2Fvideos%2F239771613740067%2F&show_text=0&width=476\" width=\"476\" height=\"476\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allowFullScreen=\"true\"></iframe><br>\r\n\r\n<b>You had some opportunities late in the day when you were really squaring things up in that match. He took driver out on the 31st hole, you laid up with an iron, and hit a wedge on there. You played the hole your way and you made the birdie, and then on 16 (the 34th hole), you could have easily not made a ten footer and been even standing on the 17th tee and yet you canned probably the biggest ten-footer in your life.</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nDefinitely. I think back to that putt a lot. It was probably the biggest shot of my life honestly. If I miss that putt it's all square and he has the momentum with two to play. So I think that was definitely the biggest moment of my life, stepping in there and making that putt. It gave me a lot of confidence going forward. To know you can make those putts under the heat, be under the gun and still perform, it was really cool and I think it will help me a lot in the future.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>It was huge and you both hit really good shots on 17, which is one of my favorite par 3s.</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nThat green complex is really severe and the greens were so firm throughout the week. If it wasn't a front pin it would have probably made the hole tougher because with a front pin you can hit a shorter iron and spin it a little bit. With a back pin, I remember balls bouncing over the green all week. Definitely not an easy hole to step up with a one stroke lead on, but got that one exactly where I wanted and I had an uphill putt with a great chance to win it outright there but just missed it.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n<b>It's shocking in a sense; he gunned it ten feet by and missed. You didn't expect it to end that way but I've got to imagine it was a sigh of relief but also a little weirdness to you at that point.</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nI expected him to make the first one. I think what you should do in match play is expect the person to pull off the shot every time, so you're never really surprised if anything happens. But he was not leaving that putt short, I understand that, and that's the competitive nature in everyone. They want to make that putt, and they don't want to leave the putt short that could have been the end (of the match). So I could see how that could easily happen. If I'm in that same situation there's no chance I'll leave that putt short. So I don't think John's going to look back and regret giving that putt a run. Not the way I envisioned winning but at the end of the day, as I said earlier, if that [happens on] that 4th hole of the day, no one talks about it, but since it's the 35th hole everyone talks about it and makes it a bigger deal than, to me, what it is.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00060247.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Ogletree wins the 2019 U.S. Amateur\"><span id=\"ContentPlaceHolder1_labArticleImageCaption\" class=\"caption\"><br/>- USGA/Chris Keane photo<br/><br/></span></div>\r\n\r\n<b>Like I said, I think you won that match with the putt, the ten footer on a hole (the 16th) that is a par 4 for you guys, a par 5 for everyone else.</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nTough hole, especially for me. I like to work the ball left-to-right, so that tee shot is always a little awkward. The pine trees hang over the fairway and you have to draw it off the bunker on the right. Blocked it out there and hit it in the bunker.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Earlier in the year, you won the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/9085/Monroe-Invitational\">Monroe Invitational</a> at a gorgeous little Donald Ross course in upstate New York.

I played it going into my freshman year of college, and I've played every year since. I've come close a couple of times. Two years prior to winning this year I shot 62 in the final round, so I thought \"Alright I'm going to come back next year; I finally had a really good round on this course!\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nI finished 7th that year and only lost by three or four strokes, so I came pretty close. I came back the next year, and I think I had a putt to tie for the win--I might have lost by two--anyway lipped it out on 18, either lost by one or two. That golf course is so good. It's not long, but it's still challenging. The winning score is one or two under every year somehow. You play the course in the practice round and you're like \"This course is very gettable\"; it's like 6800 yards, all the par fives are reachable. But for some reason, when the tournament starts, the pins get tough, they don't cut the rough and it seems to always get windy there. It's just a really good golf course and I've played some great golf.<br><br>\r\n\r\nI've stayed with the same host family every year. They were nice enough to let me stay with them four years in a row so I developed a really good relationship with them. I always wanted to go back and play that tournament, to stay with them, catch up, and get to play a really good golf course.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Let's give them a little shout-out.</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nIt's the Doyle family. Their son <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/25075/Gunnar-Doyle?p=1\">Gunnar Doyle</a> plays golf at West Point. I've known them for four years now and I've always enjoyed going back to the Monroe.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00060251.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Ogletree wins the 2019 Monroe Invitational\"><span id=\"ContentPlaceHolder1_labArticleImageCaption\" class=\"caption\"><br/>Andy Ogletree with the Monroe Invitational trophy (MIC photo)<br/><br/></span></div>\r\n\r\n<b>You went from Donald Ross (at the Monroe) to Donald Ross (at Pinehurst for the U.S. Amateur) and there are a lot of similarities in those two courses.</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nThere definitely is, especially in the green complexes. You know what you're getting into when it says that Donald Ross is the architect.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>With all the experience you gained at the Monroe, and having won there, how did you file that information away and use it at Pinehurst?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nIt had been a while since I slept on a lead at a tournament.  I've come close in a lot of college events. Last year especially I had a few second-place [finishes], lost by one a couple of times. The ACC Championship last year was the last lead I had going into the Monroe, and I ended up losing by one to <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/19645/John-Pak?p=1\">John Pak</a>, who is a great player. He kind of outplayed me the final round.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut I think all of those small experiences and learning from all the mistakes that I made definitely helped me at the U.S. Am, to feel a little more comfortable. Obviously the Monroe is not as big of a stage as the U.S. Amateur, but there are a lot of similarities in the golf courses, a lot of similarities in sleeping on a lead. To me, it doesn't matter the strength of the tournament, it is still winning a golf tournament. So that's something that I had to get used to again, and I've learned a lot abut myself and I know what my tendencies are under pressure and how to handle that. The Monroe definitely helped me.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>You come from the small town of Little Rock, Mississippi, where your dad runs a supermarket. Tell me about that.</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nHe has a Piggly Wiggly about ten minutes from my address. My address is in Little Rock, Mississippi and there's nothing there except a gas station. Just pretty much an address, a community. I went to school in Union, and my dad owns a Piggly Wiggly in Union and some other stuff. He has a small take-out steak business on Friday nights, and he owns some buildings and stuff. My granddad was mayor of the town. So our family is very well-connected with everyone there and I literally know everyone who lives in the city I'm pretty sure. To see the whole town come behind me... I would get on social media and everyone was watching. It was such a cool feeling to make your hometown proud and to give everyone a little bit of excitement, to let them cheer for a sport that they're really not used to.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00060249.jpg\"><span id=\"ContentPlaceHolder1_labArticleImageCaption\" class=\"caption\"><br/>The sign at the Piggly Wiggly says it all (WTOK-TV photo)<br/><br/></span></div>\r\n\r\n<b>What was your golf situation? How close was the nearest course and where did you pick up that first club?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nMy high school team played at a nine-hole course in Union. It was somewhere to play. It was a short course that had been there forever. To get somewhere that I was used to playing in amateur events, I had to either go to Northwood or Dancing Rabbit, which were about 30 minutes away.<br><br>\r\n\r\nDancing Rabbit had a course with bent grass greens and a course with Bermuda greens, and had one course with bermuda fairways and one with zoysia fairways. So whenever I was getting ready to go play a junior tournament I'd always have somewhere to practice to get ready for that because that pretty much covers all the course conditions in the country.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNorthwood is a shorter course, kind of like a Monroe. It's all position golf, the green complexes have a lot of slope and the greens are always super fast. So I had a good mix of different kinds of places to play, and then at school if I just wanted to go somewhere and get a quick nine in I'd go to Union Country Club with my high school team.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Sounds like you were always working, always thinking, and that's what you have to do to get better. As a junior player, you had the mindset that \"I need to putt on these greens because I'm going to go out to a junior tournament and I'm going to have those greens.\"</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nYou always have to have a plan.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n<b>Before we wrap up, tell us something about Andy Ogletree that we don't know, something that is interesting or that you want to take to the game. If you're on the PGA Tour some day, what are people going to know you for?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nI'm just a small-town kid; I'm never going to change. I love golf, I love the process of getting better. I have a big group of friends and I'm never going to change that and I'm never going to be a guy that changes the way I go about things. I'm going to \"keep doing me\", and try to get as good as I can at this game that I love and see where it takes me.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Would you ever have thought it was going to take you to a Masters invitation?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nYeah, I did. Golf has been what I have done for a really long time and I'm blessed with a really good ability from the man above, but I've worked really hard and I've always seen myself in positions like this, and why I practice so much is to give myself these opportunities. So I can't wait to hopefully take advantage of them.",

I'm more disappointed for the fact our boys on our baseball team aren't able to practice as a group.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have a really good group. Now we're probably, until the end of May, done,\" said the 41-year-old Mitchell. \"It's all about the experience for those kids. We had a good summer lined up. It's affected everybody. Baseball tournaments and golf tournaments are being canceled. As disappointing as that is, it's secondary to people losing their jobs.\"\r\n\r\nMitchell, the 2008 U.S. Mid-Amateur runner-up and 2002-2003 Illinois State Amateur champion, understands the frustration of players who were hoping the U.S. Amateur Four-Ball would be rescheduled instead of cancelled, but feels that there are more pressing issues than golf tournaments right now.\r\n\r\nMitchell and everyone else will have to wait for the 2021 U.S. Four-Ball Championship, to be played May 22-26 at Chambers Bay in University Place, Wash.",

The last time The Open was cancelled was during World War II.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nMartin Slumbers, Chief Executive of The R&A, released the following statement:<br><br>\r\n\r\n<i>Our absolute priority is to protect the health and safety of the fans, players, officials, volunteers and staff involved in The Open. We care deeply about this historic Championship and have made this decision with a heavy heart. We appreciate that this will be disappointing for a great many people around the world but this pandemic is severely affecting the UK and we have to act responsibly. It is the right thing to do.<br><br>\r\n\r\nI can assure everyone that we have explored every option for playing The Open this year but it is not going to be possible.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThere are many different considerations that go into organising a major sporting event of this scale. We rely on the support of the emergency services, local authorities and a range of other organisations to stage the Championship and it would be unreasonable to place any additional demands on them when they have far more urgent priorities to deal with. In recent weeks we have been working closely with those organisations as well as Royal St George’s, St Andrews Links Trust and the other golf bodies to resolve the remaining external factors and have done so as soon as we possibly could. We are grateful to all of them for their assistance and co-operation throughout this process.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMost of all I would like to thank our fans around the world and all of our partners for their support and understanding. At a difficult time like this we have to recognise that sport must stand aside to let people focus on keeping themselves and their families healthy and safe. We are committed to supporting our wider community in the weeks and months ahead and will do everything in our power to help golf come through this crisis.</i><br><br>\r\n\r\nWith the British Open off of the schedule, three majors remain scheduled for 2020, all having moved off of their original dates.

    "articleText": "During the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, we wrote about the Utah Golf Association and it's determined executive director Jake Miller.\r\n\r\nAt the time, Miller said he would hold the tournament in December if required to keep the 121-year streak going. After all, it's the oldest continually-held tournament in the world. As it turns out, the storied golf association didn't have to hold out for winter and the tournament starts today. We will be following it all week. \r\n\r\nHere's a repost of our coverage of the Utah Golf Association's decision process:\r\n\r\nThe Utah State Amateur Championship was first played in 1899 and has been played every year since, earning the title of the oldest continuous tournament in the world.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish flu epidemic of 1918-19 couldn't interrupt the the championship; neither could World War I or World War II.

The State Am may not look like it normally looks like in 2020 but we will be playing golf and somebody will hoist the trophy.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the championship is played, reigning U.S. Junior champion Preston Summerhays will be gunning for his third straight state championship.",

He would close out the match one hole later.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nIn 120 years of USGA competition, it was only the second hole-in-one ever recorded on a par four, a feat that would eventually be commemorated by a plaque on the tee of the hole, at John’s Island Club’s West Course in Vero Beach, Fla.\r\n\r\nSchmitz's reward was an invitation to the 2016 Masters, where he missed the cut but accumulated a lifetime of memories. <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/sammy-schmitz-made-a-lifetime-of-memories-playing-in-2016-masters/569525972/\" target=\"_blank\">Jim Souhan of the Star Tribune spoke with Schmitz</a>, who revisits the memories of Masters week every year but especially this year, as the coronavirus pandemic keeps everyone home watching reruns of past Masters tournaments.\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26028/The-Masters-rescheduled-for-November--ANWA-cancelled\">The Masters rescheduled for November, ANWA cancelled</a>\r\n\r\n\"I’m watching it yesterday, and we were reliving all of the stories\", said Schmitz to Souhan. \"We’re so bored this week that we’re re-watching all of the old Masters tournaments. We still talk about being there quite a bit, and probably always will.\"\r\n\r\nIn <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/sammy-schmitz-made-a-lifetime-of-memories-playing-in-2016-masters/569525972/\" target=\"_blank\">Souhan's article</a>, Schmitz reminisces about his Masters week experience -- everything from the greetings from security guards, to interactions with Augusta National Chairman Billy Payne, to practice rounds with players like Rickie Fowler, Bryson Dechambeau and Mike Weir, to a memorable toss by his daughter during the Par 3 competition, to Payne's reaction upon seeing Fowler's unusual golf shoes.\r\n\r\n\"Everywhere I go, people still ask me about it,\" said Schmitz. \"You have to go there to have any understanding of how amazing it is. Now, when I watch the Masters, I feel like I know every nook and cranny of Augusta National. I feel pretty lucky about that.\"\r\n\r\nSchmitz doesn't compete as much nationally these days as he did then, but he was scheduled to play in the U.S. Four-Ball, for which he qualified with his long-time partner Jesse Polk. Unfortunately, it's another major event that will be missing from Schmitz's life in 2020, as the USGA cancelled the tournament amid the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\nFortunately Schmitz has the memories of the 2016 Masters to carry him through.",

    "articleText": "The PGA Tour gets most of the attention. But it's the PGA of America that represents the 29,000 golf professionals that form the heart and soul of the game at the local level. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIn addition to running the PGA Championship and the Ryder Cup, The PGA runs championships for Club Professionals at various levels, allowing them a chance to showcase their games and earn entrance into the PGA Championship. The organization is also behind the industry's annual gathering of merchandisers in Florida, The PGA Merchandise Show. <br><br>\r\n\r\nJunior golf (PGA Junior League), apprenticeship, and countless other initiatives are all part of the PGA of America's \"grow the game\" efforts. Perhaps none is more important than the effort announced today to support a wide variety of industry members, from aspiring players to caddies and professionals as they struggle to make ends meet during the COVID-19 pandemic.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn response to the severe challenges impacting golf communities nationwide, the PGA of America established the Golf Emergency Relief Fund to provide short-term financial assistance to workers in the golf industry who face significant financial hardship, including those suffering as a result of COVID-19.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“The golf industry is in an unprecedented crisis, and our friends, colleagues and their families need our help right away,” said PGA President Suzy Whaley, PGA. “People throughout golf are driven by a strong desire to help others every day. We have to ensure that the heart and soul of our game—our people—are able to get back on their feet and continue to serve others down the road. Eventually, golf will return, but we first need to reach out and help people in our industry during this national emergency.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe fund, which begins taking applications on Thursday, April 16 at 2:00pm EDT, will be managed by E4E Relief, an independent third-party public charity.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis relief effort was initiated by the PGA of America through a lead pledge of $5 million and a matching fund for gifts by third parties of up to $2.5 million. And here's something you won't hear every day from a corporate contribution.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe PGA contribution included every member of the executive leadership team. These key industry players voluntarily reduced their compensation. On top of that, personal donations from members of the Board of Directors have been pledged. The fund is also being supported in various ways by a number of industry organizations, including the GCSAA, PGA TOUR, LPGA, USGA, NGCOA and AGM. <br><br>\r\n\r\nLearn more now, and apply April 16 at: <a href=\"https://relief.golf\" target=\"_blank\">Relief.golf</a> <br><br>\r\n\r\nPGA of America CEO Seth Waugh said:<br><br>\r\n\r\n“The golf industry steers $4 billion to charity each year. Now, we need to come to the aid of those who make this game we love so special, to help ensure their livelihood. Our leadership team is so passionate about this that each has volunteered to take a substantial reduction from their own compensation to support the PGA’s efforts. With matching, our goal is to raise at least $10 million for this important effort.”<br><br>\r\n\r\n1.) Individuals eligible to apply for aid through the Golf Emergency Relief Fund are:<br><br>\r\n\r\n2.) PGA of America Professionals (includes Members, Students and Associates)<br><br>\r\n\r\n3.)

It's truly a spectacle for players, fans, and families -- kicking off with a festive flag parade the day before play gets started. The smiles on the boys and girls of all ages are priceless. \r\n\r\nIt would have been unreasonable to expect that more than a small percentage of them could make an international trip as early as July. And rescheduling (especially at Torrey Pines' two courses) presents an insurmountable challenge. Both courses, as well as all other host courses in San Diego County, are currently closed.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe cancellation will mean a missed opportunity for every boy and girl in the field, especially those in the upper age bracket.\r\n\r\nMany of the older golfers get to play in front of college coaches for the first time - more than 100 recruiters typically make the trip to Torrey Pines to size up the talent. IMG, the tournament sponsor, runs the biggest sports academy in the world in Orlando, Florida.\r\n\r\n\"We think about the kids and their missed opportunities,\" said Mahoney. \"They worked hard to get here.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

That's the schedule for September now.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe two most important tournaments in amateur golf -- the U.S. and British Amateurs -- are now just a couple weeks apart in August, followed immediately by the second biggest tournament across the pond, the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/5484/European-Amateur-Championship\">European Amateur</a>.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26023/The-RandA-shakes-up-the-international-calendar-due-to-COVID-19\">The R&A shakes up the international calendar due to COVID-19</a><br><br>\r\n\r\nAt least two state amateurs (Florida, Kentucky) will now be played after summer ends. And many other state-level and club tournaments are being moved later in the summer or the fall.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAdd to this the hope that the college season will be played as scheduled, and the result is a crowded schedule with plenty of opportunities to play but also some unexpected conflicts.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFor example, with the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/3210/Florida-Amateur-Championship\">Florida Amateur championship</a> moving to December 17-20, it's possible if not likely that three big tournaments in the same state (the state am, the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/9262/Dixie-Amateur-2020-Men-s-Invitational\">Dixie Amateur</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/6641/South-Beach-International-Amateur\">South Beach International</a>) will have the same dates with a fourth, the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/6805/Arnold-Palmer-Cup-Matches\">Palmer Cup Matches</a>, starting the day after.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26033/Palmer-Cup-matches-moved-to-December--from-Ireland-to-Florida\">Palmer Cup matches moved to December, from Ireland to Florida</a><br><br>\r\n\r\nBut such conflict is a small price to pay for the hope of getting back to some sense of normalcy, not just in our world of competitive amateur golf, but also in our broader way of life. Here's hoping that we can all do everything we can to get us to where we want to be: back at work, back at school, and back on the golf course testing ourselves like no other game can.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, AmateurGolf.com will stay on top of <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26004/List-of-amateur-tournaments-affected-by-the-coronavirus-outbreak\">all of the schedule changes</a> as the rest of the year slowly starts to take shape.",

All three are first-time finalists for the award, which many consider to be golf's equivalent of the Heisman Trophy.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMost of the spring college golf season, along with the NCAA championships were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But collegiate golf is fortunate to be played in both fall and spring seasons, and there was still plenty of collegiate and amateur golf played in the past year. The selection committee -- made up of 30 leaders and experts in amateur, college and professional golf -- considered accomplishments over the period May 21, 2019 to March 12, 2020 in making their selections.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n<BR>Normally the award is presented during the PGA Tour event at Colonial Country Club in a ceremony similar to the Heisman Award, with each finalist highlighted and the entire presentation streamed live. With the uncertainty of gatherings of any sort being held (especially at the first events when the PGA Tour returns to action) the decision was made to cancel the planned June 4 awards banquet.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe 2020 recipient, who will be named in June, earns the first invitation into the PGA TOUR’s 2021 Charles Schwab Challenge and will be honored during that week’s festivities. <br><br>\r\n\r\n“On behalf of the Hogan Trophy Award Foundation, I would like to congratulate John, Ricky and Sahith on being named finalists for the most prestigious award in men’s college and amateur golf,” Ben Hogan Award Chairman Harold Muckleroy said. “While the college golf season may have been shortened, the accomplishments of these three men over a nine-month period stand tall.

(That effort continues through the month of April so visit Titleist, FootJoy, Scotty Cameron, or KJUS websites to stock up now.) <br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd they weren't done yet -- the company is also participating in Rain Suits for Responders to collect new or gently used golf rain suits and deliver them directly to healthcare workers on the frontlines. (This writer will be going through his inventory right after posting.) <br><br>\r\n\r\nToday, Titleist and FootJoy are tapping into their amazing network of Ambassadors and Tour Players to auction off once-in-a-lifetime experiences with 100% of the proceeds going to CDP's COVID-19 Response Fund. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe week-long online auction, which begins today (April 23) at 10:00 a.m. EDT and closes on April 30 at 9:00 p.m. EDT, is being presented by Titleist, FootJoy, Vokey, Scotty Cameron and Kjus. <br><br>\r\n\r\n“Like so many others, the Acushnet team is committed to being a positive force in support of front line health care workers, the local communities in which we operate, golf professionals, and others in the industry, who have been most affected by this pandemic,” said David Maher, President and CEO, Acushnet Company.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>WHAT''S UP FOR BID</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nHere are some of the twelve Titleist/FootJoy experiences you can bid on -- or just enjoy thinking about while watching the money being raised.. How about an opportunity to tee it up with a top-ranked tour players Ian Poulter or Justin Thomas, or schedule a golf lesson with a Butch Harmon or Peter Kostis? You can get fit like a Tour Player with Bob Vokey, or experience Pebble Beach with local resident Jim Nance. (Nance recorded a personal video message about the program from his amazing replica green of Pebble Beach no. 7 <a href=\"https://chipin.rallyup.com/charitygolfauction\" target=\"_blank\">which you can view here</a>.)<br><br>\r\n\r\nWin one of these experiences, and you'll have something to look forward to when life (and golf) return to normal, all while ‘Chipping In’ to make an impact with COVID-19 Relief Charity Golf Auction.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<B>AUCTION BENEFICIARIES</B><BR><BR>\r\n\r\nTitleist and FootJoy's Chipping In Auction delivers 100% of the proceeds towards the relief efforts of three deserving organizations: CDP COVID-19 Response Fund; the United Way chapters of Greater New Bedford and San Diego County, supporting the local communities where the majority of the Titleist and FootJoy U.S. associates work and live; and, following the lead of the PGA of America and other golf organizations, the Golf Emergency Relief Fund.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“We are grateful to our many partners, brand ambassadors and associates for their contributions,\" added Acushnet CEO Maher. \"As we work together to endure these challenging times, and collectively look forward to the better days that lie ahead.” <br><br>\r\nTo view the Auction introduction video presented by Jim Nantz and a description of the Experiences, please visit the COVID-19 Relief Charity Golf Auction site at \r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://chipin.rallyup.com/charitygolfauction\" target=\"_blank\">chipin.rallyup.com/charitygolfauction</a>\r\n\r\n",

In addition, champions were crowned in five handicap flights. The original story appears below.\r\n\r\n<b>Update April 28: </b>A reader has told us that there was also a one-day amateur event -- the Glenmoor Amateur -- in Utah on April 18. The vast majority of our listings are multi-day events so we missed that one but it's good to know that it happened!</i>\r\n\r\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has altered the competitive amateur golf calendar, forcing <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26004/List-of-amateur-tournaments-affected-by-the-coronavirus-outbreak\">a wave of postponements, cancellations and reschedules</a>.\r\n\r\nAt AmateurGolf.com, we try to stay in constant contact with tournament directors of amateur golf tournaments -- from the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/TheMajorsOfAmateurGolf\">Majors of Amateur Golf</a> to club-level events -- so golfers can discover new tournaments and build their playing schedules. Our current tournament listings number over 3000.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nWhile the summer and fall golf schedules continue to fill up with rescheduled events joining those previously scheduled, the spring season has dried up as most states remain \"locked down\".\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26041/Fall-calendar-becoming-crowded-as-tournaments-get-rescheduled\">Fall calendar becoming crowded as tournaments get rescheduled</a>\r\n\r\nOne by one, we've had to add the words \"CANCELLED\" or \"POSTPONED\" to our April tournament listings, or for the lucky ones that have been rescheduled, to update the tournament dates to later in the year.\r\n\r\nBut there is one -- and only one -- April tournament in our database that is proceeding as scheduled. And it might just put Graham, North Carolina on the map.\r\n\r\nWhere is Graham, N.C.? A look at the map shows it about halfway between Greensboro and Durham, right on Interstate 40 in the north-central part of the state. With a population of around 15000, the town was named after former U.S. Senator and governor of North Carolina, William Alexander Graham.\r\n\r\nSouthwick Golf Course sits about five miles south of town, and plays host to the 9th annual <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/8852/Graham-City-Amateur-Championship\">Graham City Amateur</a> on the weekend of April 25-26. The course dates from 1968 and does not currently have an operating website.\r\n\r\nThe Graham City Am is a 36-hole individual stroke play tournament, with flights determined by first-round score. The $100 entry fee covers two rounds of golf, lunch, and awards.\r\n\r\nA number of precautions are being undertaken to ensure players can compete safely, including one player per cart, online payments, no clubhouse access, removal of rakes, no touching of the flagstick, and leaving a piece of a pool noodle inside each hole so that the ball can be easily retrieved.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FSouthwickGolf%2Fposts%2F10157290184441733&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"746\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowTransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe>\r\n\r\nAn outdoor scoreboard is being utilized for displaying results, with players discouraged from congregating. Tournament organizers are confident that they can conduct the event safely, and the players are sure to be excited to get back onto the golf course and compete.\r\n\r\nElsewhere across the golf world, tournament directors are cautiously waiting to \"reopen\". There are a few events in early May that are still planning to go ahead as scheduled, and (for now) mid-to-late May looks to be the time when competitive amateur golf will come back in a more significant way. As always, AmateurGolf.com will do our best to stay on top of all tournament news and schedule changes.\r\n\r\nAs with the economy and the rest of life, restarting competitive amateur golf won't be like flipping a switch, more like turning a dial. Hopefully tournament organizers everywhere can get golfers back out to the course to compete in a safe way, as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Graham City Amateur is leading the way.",

The tournament did everything possible to keep the 60 player field safe, and we will be posting a podcast with champion (and the course's GM) Tony Byerly shortly. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nIn North Carolina, courses never closed during the pandemic. And while things chug away fairly close to normal at Graham's public course (Southwick) many North Carolina resort destinations like Pinehurst have suffered greatly since their revenue relies on tourism to thrive. (Pinehurst, it should be noted, is contributing to COVID-19 relief by auctioning off some really unique experiences. We applaud their effort.)<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn Texas, courses are also open for play, but social distancing has caused the tradition of caddies to also suffer an economic hit. Without jobs, the \"looper\" -- just like the restaurant server and so many other professions -- can't earn a living. <br><br>\r\n\r\nMaridoe Golf Club in Carrollton (north of Dallas) is hosting the Maridoe Samaritan Fund Invitational this week The fund benefits caddies, and the tournament is providing a much-needed chance to compete for pros looking forward to getting back on tour and collegiate players who missed most of their spring season (and a chance to play for the national title) due to the COVID-19 epidemic. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd there is plenty of rust to be shaken off.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFor players missing their frequent checks of the PGA Tour and Collegiate/Amateur leaderboards (we hope you <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/tournament-scores/\">do so</a> on AmateurGolf.com) there is a live leaderboard.

His co-leader Vick was more consistent with a couple of rounds of 2-under 70. But Vick did have a sweet run of four-straight birdies in the first round starting at No. 3 and should be a strong contender for the title in tomorrow's final round. Vick, from Houston, had a top-10 at the Amer-Ami Invitational among his three starts before Texas' spring golf campaign was cut short. He is currently ranked No. 78 in the<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-rankings/golfweek-agc-men\"> Golfweek/AmateurGolf.com World Amateur Ranking</a>.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFormer Alabama standout, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/13085/Davis-Riley?p=1\">Davis Riley</a> is a stroke back after today's round of even par left him at 3-under 141. <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/5404/Tony-Romo?p=1\">Tony Romo</a> (do we even have to say Cowboy's legend anymore?) is T37 after rounds of 78 and 80.

Scheffler closed with a bogey-free 67 at Maridoe Golf Club to win by a shot over <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/14176/Will-Zalatoris?p=1\">Will Zalatoris</a>, who closed with 65. Our favorite Norwegian golfer, (and AmateurGolf alum) <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/14160/Viktor-Hovland?p=1\">Viktor Hovland</a> made a nice run after starting the tournament with a 75. The 2018 U.S. Amateur champion and rookie PGA Tour winner's final round was ten shots better than his rust-worthy opener. <br><BR>\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nIt's certainly nice to see Zalatoris -- the former Wake Forest and amateur standout -- continuing the form that saw him make 5-for-5 cuts on the Korn Ferry Tour before the season was paused. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<br><br>Top-ranked amateurs did their part as well, with Texas golfer <a ref=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/19009/Travis-Vick?p=1\">Travis Vick</a> and Oklahoma State's <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/17727/Austin-Eckroat?p=1\">Austin Eckroat</a> playing well, especially considering the stress of having their NCAA seasons cancelled and having to do e-learning to finish the school year.<br><br>\r\n\r\nVick, who shared the 36-hole lead with Scheffler at 4-under 140, posted 74 today to finish 6th at 2-under 212 while Eckroat tied fourth with Harry Higgs at 4-under on the heals of a solid 70 today.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/5404/Tony-Romo?p=1\">Tony Romo</a> was in the field (he finished T37 at 20-over), as was <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/8190/Jordan-Spieth?p=1\">Jordan Spieth</a>. You won't see Spieth (a member of Maridoe) on the leaderboard because previous commitments caused him to miss the first two rounds. He played as a marker today with Romo, and even scored an ace -- sort of.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOn the the 110-yard, par-3 17th hole, Spieth flew his sand wedge tee shot into the plastic spacer placed inside of the cup for social distancing.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"We were playing a little two-on-two match and my partner was already on the green, about 12 feet, so I said, 'I may as well go right at it, right?'\" said Spieth, \"It never left the stick and I knew it was going to land somewhere around the hole and sure enough it landed in the hole.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter hitting the spacer on the fly and making a loud clank, Spieth’s ball ricocheted back into the water hazard (I still can't call it a penalty area). <br><br>\r\n\r\nEven though Romo said it would be a double-bogey in their match, Spieth said he was going to count it since he's been shut out of aces for a while. \"In a 6-feet-apart way, drinks are on me.\"\r\n\r\n<br><br>We love seeing any golf get played right now, and will be watching champion Scottie Scheffler closely when the Tour returns to competition in June in Ft.

    "articleText": "The coronavirus pandemic has rearranged the 2020 competitive golf schedule. Professional majors have been rescheduled or cancelled, the college season was cut short, and the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/TheMajorsOfAmateurGolf\">Majors of Amateur Golf</a> calendar thinned out.\r\n\r\nThese are the amateur majors in the U.S. that have already been cancelled: the NCAA Championship, the Augusta National Women's Amateur, the Dogwood, the Monroe, the Southwestern, the Northeast, the Sahalee Players, the Women's Southern, the Women's Eastern, the Women's Porter Cup, and four USGA amateur championships (the two Four-Balls and the two Juniors).\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26004/List-of-amateur-tournaments-affected-by-the-coronavirus-outbreak\">List of amateur tournaments affected by the coronavirus outbreak</a>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nOthers like the Curtis Cup and Sunnehanna have been rescheduled, and still more are in limbo, planning to proceed as scheduled but wary of any new outbreaks that might threaten. And then there is the question of how far and how often players will be willing to travel to compete until the pandemic is perceived to be under control.\r\n\r\nAn unexpected beneficiary of the coronavirus-induced chaos? It might just be the state amateur championship.\r\n\r\nOnce considered among the most important tournaments to win, state amateurs have seen their fortunes decline over the years. Top players have increasingly elected to mimic the tour pros that the strive to become by traveling the country to play the best from other states, first as juniors and then as amateurs.\r\n\r\nConsider these numbers:\r\n\r\n• Only 2 of the top 10-ranked players from California (and 7 of the top-20) in the year-end Golfweek/AmateurGolf.com World Amateur Ranking played in the 2019 California Amateur. No. 3 <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24203/Cameron-Sisk?p=1\">Cameron Sisk</a>, No. 10 <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/17698/Noah-Woolsey?p=1\">Noah Woolsey</a> and No. 11 <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21955/Devon-Bling?p=1\">Devon Bling</a> were the highest-ranked players in the field.\r\n\r\n• In Texas, none of the state's top-10-ranked players (and only 3 of the top 20) competed in the Texas Amateur. The highest ranked player was No. 12 <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/17067/Blaine-Hale?p=1\">Blaine Hale</a>.\r\n\r\n• In Florida, the only top-10 player in the 2019 Florida Amateur was No. 10 <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/71327/Luke-Gifford\">Luke Gifford</a>. Four of the top 20 players in the state were in the field.\r\n\r\nSome smaller states fare better. In Massachusetts, the top 3 players in the state (<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/17729/Jimmy-Hervol?p=1\">Jimmy Hervol</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/88766/Matt-Parziale\">Matt Parziale</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21476/Steven-DiLisio?p=1\">Steven DiLisio</a>) played in the 2019 Massachusetts Amateur, as did 5 of the top 10. But Massachusetts is an outlier in the much larger trend -- top players have been skipping their state ams in large numbers, choosing instead to travel elsewhere.\r\n\r\nCould this change in 2020? The signs point to \"yes\".\r\n\r\nAs society re-opens, we're not seeing a mad rush to get back onto planes, into restaurants, into stores, etc. People are rightly being cautious, easing back in instead of diving. So too it might be for amateur golf. If more top players stay closer to home, we might expect to see more of them competing for their state amateur titles.\r\n\r\nWe will keep a close eye on this and follow up as the summer progresses.",

    "articleText": "<i><b>“You may take it from me that there are two kinds of golf. There is golf and tournament golf, and they are not at all the same.”</i> -- Bobby Jones</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nAt AmateurGolf.com, keeping in touch with golf tournaments is at the core of what we do. We constantly communicate with tournament directors and associations,  in order to provide our members with the most accurate information. Lately, it hasn’t been as much about the “when, where and how to enter” as much as cancellations and postponements. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00060353.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\nBut as golf went from less than 50% for courses opened in the U.S. to more than 75% by mid-May, the news has gotten much brighter for the competitive game. And as we’ve reported in our <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26055/The-return-of-the-state-am-\">Return of the State Amateur</a> story, the tide has shifted away from the majors -- that require travel and hosted lodging -- and towards events that are closer to home. I’ve already played in one, a Torrey Pines Men’s Club single-day event on May 3. And I’ve been in touch with two events that played in late April. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Related Content:</b><hr><ul class=\"contentList\"><li><img src=\"//www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00060350.jpg\" alt=\"Tournament Talk: Rob Couture on the Maridoe Invitational\"><div class=\"newsLatestTeaser\"><a href=\"/golf-tournament-news/26056/Tournament-Talk--Rob-Couture-on-the-Maridoe-Invitational\">Tournament Talk: Rob Couture on the Maridoe Invitational</a><br/>May 04, 2020 - We took great interest in the Dallas fund-raising event that featured Scottie Scheffler, Tony Romo, and Jordan Spieth</div></li><li><img src=\"//www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00060348.jpg\" alt=\"Tournament Talk: How to Safely Run a Golf Tournament\"><div class=\"newsLatestTeaser\"><a href=\"/golf-tournament-news/26057/Tournament-Talk--How-to-Safely-Run-a-Golf-Tournament\">Tournament Talk: How to Safely Run a Golf Tournament</a><br/>May 04, 2020 - With all precautions in place, and a well thought-out game plan, The Graham City went off without a hitch</div></li></ul><hr>\r\n\r\nGiven my twenty years of experience running the website, and events of our own (including a <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/9071/AmateurGolf-com-2020-Two-Man-Links-at-Bandon-Dunes\">major destination event</a> at Bandon Dunes) I decided to put forth a guide to running golf tournaments in the Post-COVID-19 world. It is my hope that players and tournament organizers will continue to provide us with information on what works for them, so we can keep the dialog going and return to competing -- not just playing -- a very safe game. I can’t remember who said it, but if you’re six feet away from someone in golf, you’re risking getting hit in the head by a golf club!<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>REGISTRATION & PROMOTION</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nIf your tournament hasn’t moved to online registration, this is an excellent time to do so. Payment is actually easier for a tournament in the \"no touch\" world than it is for normal golf. If you run a 36-hole tournament, over two days, you only have to collect once and my guess is that 75% of tournaments take online registrations already. But most of these still allow payment by check. Now is the time to eliminate that and require online registration only.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBenefits: You’ll reduce the amount of touch-points, make players more confident that your event is really going to happen (and that they have recourse with their credit card company if it cancels) as well as making it easier to put registrations into a scoring system like Golf Genius.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHere are several options for online registration:<br><br>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"articleImage\">\r\n                <div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\">\r\n                <img src=\"/images/uploads/00060354.jpg\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n<u>Golf Genius</u><br>\r\nOnline registration via credit card is an integral part of their premium product. So if you've been looking for a reason to upgrade, this is it. If you use their software (especially if you have the premium version) this is the way to go. Your registered players will already be in the tournament field, ready to put into pairing groups and score.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<u>E-Commerce or POS System</u><br>\r\nMany tournaments run by public or private courses simply take online payments within their point-of-sale or e-commerce platform. It gets the job done, especially if the platform used has an event module or the ability to add fields to collect handicap, age, and other tournament-specific info.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<u>Square, Stripe, or PayPal</u><br>\r\nThese payment platforms are perfect for anyone that doesn't have a merchant account to accept credit cards. Signing up is simple, and most offer form tools to allow you to collect basic registrant data. But a combination of one of these platforms with JotForm (see below) or a similar product allows you to collect more data and work with it easier.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<u>JotForm</u><br>\r\nIf your club or tournament isn't in a position to pay for software, I recommend JotForm. Even though we have our own registration software at AmateurGolf.com, we often use JotForm to create quick and easy online forms that work well on computers, tablets, or phones. JotForm has credit card processing integrated into all of their plans. I suggest the Silver plan at $39/month -- you will need a PayPal, Stripe, or Merchant account to process the payment.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThese providers allow you to accept all types of credit and debit cards. You could use Venmo or PayPal, however that would require your players to have an account and it will be tough to get 100% online participation that way. The fees are in the 3-5% range.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>BUNKER RAKES</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nIf you have played golf during the pandemic you know that while the raised cups and putting with the flagstick in get most of the attention, not having bunker rakes and taking one club length relief from footprints is also pretty weird. So I'm going to float an idea and a new golf acronym that I hope will take hold, <b>PBR</b>. (USGA are you listening?) It's not the beer I'm referring to. It's the Personal Bunker Rake. I've already got my own, a cool old-school wooden deal I bought for the golf room years ago.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut you shouldn't have to bring your own to a tournament. What if every tournament player was provided with a sanitized rake to put into their bag? I called Sam Vance at Wittek Golf Supply -- the leading provider of golf course operational equipment -- to discuss the idea.<br><br>\r\n\r\n            <div class=\"articleImage\">\r\n                <div style=\"float:left; padding-right: 15px;\">\r\n                <img src=\"/images/uploads/00060351.jpg\">\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n \"Great minds think alike,\" said Vance when I told him my idea. \"We were just discussing that in the office.\" \r\n\r\n<br><br>As it turns out, his company has an inventory of 1400 wood rakes with painted handles in 48\" which is just a little longer than a driver. They also have 800 aluminum rakes, in 54\". Aluminum would be easiest to sanitize, but the painted wood should be fine as well. The rakes come in boxes of 12 for $78 (wood) and $87 (aluminum). <br><br>\r\n\r\nBUY ONLINE:<br>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.wittekgolf.com/Economy-Bunker-Rake\" target=\"_blank\">Economy Bunker Rake at Wittek Golf</a>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\nA golf course could purchase these to use for events. Because here's the thing - if you thought players did a poor job raking bunkers prior to the pandemic, what do you think sand traps are going to look like over the next 6-12 months -- even in golf tournaments? Many players are going to choose their safety over the next player's bunker lie. <br><br>\r\n\r\nPurchasing personal rakes won't completely solve the problem, and I still think committees should put a local rule in effect allowing one club length relief from footprints and related damage (not plugged or bad lies). And even if you don't have personal rakes, you could keep your bunkers in tour-quality shape during tournaments by doing what Southwick GM Tony Byerly did during the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/8852/Graham-City-Amateur-Championship\">Graham City Championship</a>, one of the only tournaments played in April of 2020.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26048/Is-this-the-only-amateur-golf-tournament-being-played-this-April-\"><b>Related: </b>Is this the only amateur golf tournament being played this April?</a><br><br>\r\n\r\n\"We had a member of the maintenance crew follow groups around in a cart raking bunkers,\" said Byerly in a recent <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26057/Tournament-Talk--How-to-Safely-Run-a-Golf-Tournament\">Tournament Talk podcast</a>.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThat's the kind of attention to detail that your players will appreciate. In the last round, when leaders have been repaired, there is no reason the outcome should be effected by a preferred lie in a bunker. Eliminate the need to take one, and the tournament can be run closer to normal.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>PAIRING GROUPS</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen I first started AmateurGolf.com, running a \"<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/AmateurGolfComTour\">Tour</a>\" was a bigger part of our business than it is now. I couldn't for the life of me understand why it made sense to run threesomes instead of foursomes for individual stroke play events. That's 25% less revenue over the same amount of time, I figured. But the fact is that tournament golf flows like lava with foursomes, unless a very strict pace of play policy is enforced or the course is very forgiving. <br><br>\r\n\r\nI changed my mind on that long before I heard of COVID-19. We don't do it all the time, but whenever possible we do 1st and 10th tee starts with an 84 player field limit. In the post-COVID-19 world, reduced field sizes make sense on a number of levels. Cart availability, as discussed below, is just one of those.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>CARTS</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nIt appears that single-rider carts are going to be with us for a while. But most courses don't have enough carts to accommodate a full field event. To avoid the added expense (and possible availability issues) of golf cart rental, you'll want to think about prioritizing carts for those who need them most, starting with seniors or anyone with a physical handicap. It's something you should ask about in the online registration process so you'll know who wants to ride and you can plan accordingly.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>PARTIALLY SUBMERGED CUPS</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nI played golf on March 19, right before San Diego courses closed, with cups raised above ground level. I didn't enjoy putting very much that day. If your course has no choice but to use raised cups (perhaps due to municipal requirements) then I suggest a one foot circle be painted around them for tournament day, as I saw a course in the UK implement. If your ball hits the cup, and stays within the circle, it is deemed to be holed.<br><br>\r\n\r\nA far better option, and one that seems to be commonplace now for everyday play, is to have partially submerged cups. This avoids touch-points because a simple \"two finger extraction\" (the TFE, what the heck) can allow you to retrieve your ball without touching anything. Byerly, the GM of Southwick GC, used cut-off styrofoam pool noodles to accomplish this. Other courses flip the cups upside down - depending on the brand and flagstick system this works equally well. Whatever you do, it won't effect play very much -- in 36 holes I didn't see one member of my foursome at Torrey Pines get an unfair break. But Jordan Spieth, playing in the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/9294/Maridoe-Samaritan-Fund-Invitational\">Maridoe Invitatonal</a>, did have an obvious fly-in ace rejected when it bounced off the pool noodle into the water in front of the green. Ouch.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>FLAGSTICK - LEAVE IT IN</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nDid the USGA know something when they changed the rules to allow the flagstick to be left in on the putting green? Whether you like it or not, it's certainly less of a shock to use the flagstick on putts. Of course, tournaments should require this until golf courses deem it is safe to remove the pin. Like getting groceries delivered at home, the forced implementation of this rule will lead some people to play golf this way all the time. The only time it has bugged me is when putting a windy three footer and literally seeing the flagstick swirl around in the bottom of the cup. I decided to use the old putting adage \"miss 'em quick\" and just get up and knock those testers into the flag, moving or not.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<B>SCORING</B><br><br>\r\n\r\nAnother thing that is likely to accelerate due to the pandemic is the use of electronic scoring. The gold standard for this is Golf Genius, because it's likely that you are already using the free  (to USGA member clubs) or premium version of their software. If you're doing pairings, and entering scores in Golf Genius, you'll want to turn on the live scoring feature and provide players with a GGID (another acronym, I know!) so they can enter their scores on their phone. I spoke to Golf Genius CEO Mike Zisman about what he's seeing, and it's clearly been good for their business and customers.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"Our customers are innovating for us,\" said Zisman.\"They're using our product to build online pro shops, online grocery stores, online tee sheets, and to do live scoring.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nZisman, an IBM executive turned golf software entrepreneur, told me about new Golf Genius features that make tons of sense for tournament organizers during the pandemic, including allowing players to make their own tee time and pairing group. It's called Open Tee Sheet. Making your own group for a tournament is another way to keep a close social circle. And why not? I've always believed that players should be able to request a pairing for the first round, but it can be hard to manage all the special requests. Open Tee Sheet solves that problem. And using a handheld device to enter scores is a heck of a lot easier than the scoring systems on cart GPS screens.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to use Golf Genius, there are other standalone systems like VPAR that provide the service, for a fee. Or you can do what Tony Byerly did at the Graham City - he put scorecards on the individual carts and \"pre-switched\" them by asking players to get into the cart with another member of their group's scorecard. After the round, he setup a social distancing friendly group of tables near his cart barn, and had players agree on scores from a safe distance. At Maridoe in Dallas, they simply had players take a picture of their scorecard and text it to the tournament director. I love that combination of old and new school technology. At Torrey Pines, our Men's Club emails a PDF of the scorecard \"file\" so you can pick the page yours is on, and print it in advance to eliminate handing out cards and the multiple touch-points that brings into play.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<B>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</B><BR><BR>\r\n\r\nMany basic services that players are used to will be slow to return. Food and Beverage service, multiple people in the clubhouse or pro shop (if either is open to players at all) mean that you need to communicate with players what to expect before they arrive for their tee times. And speaking of which, there is no way I would even think about running a shotgun format tournament right now. By nature, these are group gatherings.<br><br>\r\n\r\nEven the double tee start increases the number of players on the driving range at one time (if the range is open at all). And what to do in case of a rain delay? With no possibility of sheltering in the clubhouse, the best option may be for players to shelter individually in their cars, with communication on restarting delivered electronically.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<u>Organizers:</u> I hope that you have found this guide informative. I would love to hear about what you are doing to make your tournament safe and competitive at the same time. Please use our <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/AboutUs/Contact\">contact us</a> page to get in touch -- I promise to reply to each and every person who takes the time to send information. This will be a dynamic story where we add the best ideas. Tournament golf can be just as safe as everyday golf, while providing us the respite we need. The service provided by the tournament committee and volunteers has never been more important.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<u>Players:</u> please be kind to your fellow players, and thank your tournament organizers for allowing you to compete. Now more than ever, we should focus on enjoying the competition, and the hard work of volunteers (especially the unpaid rules officials) who could be playing golf themselves instead of watching us grind it out for par.",

    "title": "Golf Channel's GOLF Am Tour to shut down permanently",
    "teaser": "After previously cancelling the 2020 season, the largest amateur tour in the world has shut off its scoreboards forever",
    "articleText": "This one's a shocker. The largest and most successful national golf tour for amateurs has been shutdown permanently.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Golf Am Tour had cautiously suspended the season on April 22 (including both national championships) via an email to players. It is unlikely that anyone was surprised, but I'm sure that many were disappointed.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut the reaction to a permanent cancellation will, no doubt, be much stronger. I, for one don't get surprised by much any more, but this one has me scratching my head. In a May 13 email to players and corresponding website post, Golf Am Tour said:<br><br>\r\n\r\n<i>As you are aware, the GOLF Am Tour made the difficult decision to cancel all local and regional major events (including the 2020 National and Senior National Championships) due to complications surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, we’ve now made the decision to permanently shut down the GOLF Am Tour effective immediately.</i>\r\n\r\n<br><br>When you consider the financial impact that not having televised golf has had on the parent company, the decision to shut down the Am Tour for the season makes sense. In the framework of social distance golf as opposed to social gather golf, the safety of players and staff poses a potential liability to a large company. Of course, Golf Channel is concerned with safety, not just liability. To their credit they are providing players a pro-rata credit of their 2020 membership fee, refunds for any tournament entry fees paid, and a free one year subscription to their Golf Pass program. <br><br>\r\nFrom the purely financial side, player participation -- especially to their often sold-out \"super-regional\" and national events -- would definitely be affected by the coronavirus. Beyond that there's the issue of sponsorship. Golf and travel companies that make up the bulk of Golf Am Tour's sponsors have had to scrutinize (or freeze altogether) their budgets this year, even more than the Great Recession of 2008-2009.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhich, coincidentally, is when Golf Channel acquired the American Amateur Golf Tour and changed the name to the Golf Channel Amateur Tour, and more recently the Golf Am Tour. To understand the permanent cancellation as opposed to the rest of 2020 requires a look at how the tour is structured.<br><br>\r\n\r\nGolf Channel's name and advertising power did a lot to build the tour since that acquisition, and it's hard to believe that something so strong would not be worth saving. But Golf Channel didn't have complete control over the day-to-day operation of these events. The hundreds of one-day Am Tour tournaments -- in geographical territories across the U.S. -- were run by franchise owners. Trying to implement a COVID-19 safety plan across company owned territories would be hard enough. Doing so with franchise owners would be akin to the federal government telling states what to do. It's messy.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOver the years, I have sent hundreds of players to the GCAmTour.com when they were looking for a national golf tour to travel and play events in. State and regional golf associations make it difficult to cross borders and play events due to membership requirements. The Golf Am Tour solved that problem with one uniform membership. I was a fan.<br><br>\r\n\r\nExtending a business trip to a city like Atlanta for an extra day or two to play a competitive event -- using your same membership and accruing valuable player-of-the-year points, made sense. It's no surprise that former professional athletes like MLB pitcher Mark Mulder loved getting the competitive juices flowing on the Golf Am Tour.<br>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Have you played a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GolfChannel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GolfChannel</a> Am Tour event?</p>— AmateurGolf.com (@amateurgolfcom) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amateurgolfcom/status/1260938006640263170?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 14, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><br>\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons that AmateurGolf.com didn't become a \"tour\" after we started running tournaments shortly after stating up in 2000 was exactly this risk factor. Major economic, health, and even wartime shocks are part of life. And the infrastructure you need to have in place to run a national tour is tough to disassemble.<br><br>\r\nBut I still have to ask myself, why throw away ten-plus years of hard work by cancelling the Golf Am Tour permanently? What happens to players, franchise owners, and employees? Surely this is a business worth saving.<br><br>\r\nMy guess is that the strongest regional franchise owners will start running events on their own. Players will find competition elsewhere; perhaps golf professionals should take advantage of the opportunity by offering one or two day competitive events or boosting the marketing of city championships. <br><br>\r\nAmateurGolf.com will continue to list each and every one of them, and if you need help getting the word out - just use our contact button to tell us about your event and we'll take it from there.<br><br>\r\nAnd if you are looking for one day competitive events, check your state and local golf association (this is an excuse to join if you haven't already -- some run full schedules of \"events for everybody\") or visit our partner the <a href=\"https://usgolfchallenge.com/\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Golf Challenge</a>. The U.S. Golf Challenge offers two-person best ball events that provide the chance to qualify for a national championship, and potentially represent USA in a Ryder Cup-style match vs. Ireland. It doesn't get much better than that!\r\n\r\n",

    "teaser": "One year ago, Sahith Theegala couldn't even take a full swing; now the awards are coming in like a Wave",
    "articleText": "<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26060/Sahith-Theegala-of-Pepperdine-wins-the-Haskins-Award\">2020 Haskins Award winner Sahith Theegala</a> could not even make a full swing this time a year ago.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHaving surgery on his left wrist last January, Theegala was kept away from the game he so loved for months.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“At first it was brutal,” Theegala said to AmateurGolf.com in a Zoom interview. “Obviously I haven’t gone that long without golf for any reason. Mentally at first, it was just like ‘C’mon I can’t play the thing I love’. Even when I’m not playing golf I usually like to do other stuff like play basketball and I couldn’t even do that.”<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mO_bDG4kMWc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>\r\n\r\nDespite the long recovery that kept him off the course, Theegala stayed positive throughout the process.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“That was the whole point of taking the redshirt year. Obviously I needed the surgery but I was thinking about the long term… I gained a new perspective during my rehab time where it really helped me take my mind off golf a little bit.”<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nWith a refreshed outlook on life and his game, Theegala’s game took a turn for the better at the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25192/Theegala-s-comeback-summer-continues-with-SCGA-Amateur-win\">Southern California Amateur</a> after knocking the rust off.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I think I literally swung it the best ever,” Theegala said. “My rhythm was just so keyed in. It was so little stress because funny enough I don’t think I putted or chipped as well as I did the previous three events but I hit the ball so well… It felt like through four days I hardly missed a shot. I knew I certainly found something with the way I was swinging. It definitely turned it around for me.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nTheegala kept the momentum riding from his July win through the fall season and well into the winter as he picked up <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25862/Master-of-the-Amateurs--Sahith-Theegala-wins-by-4\">a win at the Australian Master of the Amateurs</a> in January. With Victoria Golf Club playing hard and fast, the final round proved to be a true test with winds gusting up to 40 miles per hour. With a five-shot lead heading into the final round, Theegala squandered his lead on the front nine posting a six-over-par score through seven holes.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“The turning point in that round was hole eight,” Theegala said. “I killed a drive into the wind. I think I had a four iron like 200-yards straight into the wind and ended up hitting that to eight-feet and made [an] eagle and that turned it around.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nTheegala settled in after that, making a birdie on nine and closing the door on the back nine with seven straight pars giving him a five-shot lead on 17 where he closed with a birdie and bogey to take home the Green Jacket.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTheegala almost took the collegiate winter break off to rest and let his body heal but his competitiveness simply would not let that happen.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“I initially thought I was going to go winter break without playing,” said Theegala. “But I’ve always been a competitor and I was like ‘Oh man, I don’t think I can do that’... ‘How about I challenge myself and go to Australia and gain a lot of experience [playing internationally]’.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nThat competitor mentality stems from one of his childhood idols, Kobe Bryant. Theegala famously <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25912/Wearing-a-Kobe-jersey--Theegala-wins-the-Southwestern-Invite\">won the Southwestern Invitational while wearing a Bryant jersey</a> to tie a Pepperdine record of four solo wins.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“Just like so many others, he was my childhood idol and a large part why I play sports the way I do,” Theegla said. “I had the thought that it would be cool if I could honor Kobe in some way on the final day [of the tournament]… for me to have that one-shot lead coming to 18 and get the victory there, it couldn’t have been a better ending. It worked out perfectly. I was just really glad I was able to pay respects to Kobe; obviously, I wish I never had to do that.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nMidway through the spring season, Theegala and his Pepperdine teammates were poised for a deep postseason run, having ascended to the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26024/Pepperdine-is-No--1-NCAA-Men-s-Golf-Team-in-Final-Coaches-Poll\">No. 1 ranking in the College Coaches Poll</a>.\r\n\r\nBut with the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic cutting his senior season short, Theegala will have to take consolation in the wave of awards coming his way. In addition to the Haskins Award, he is a <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26046/GCAA-names-the-2019-20-NCAA-Division-I-All-American-teams\">First Team All-American</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26042/Three-Hogan-Award-Finalists-Named\">favorite to win the Hogan Award</a>. He now looks forward to turning professional once golf and the rest of the world returns to a new normal.",

    "articleText": "With coronavirus (COVID-19) putting a stranglehold on all facets of life, the University of Akron had to make a very tough decision.\r\n\r\nThe university ended its men’s golf program last week as the institution was forced to make cuts while facing a budgetary shortage due to the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“To our current student-athletes–I’m so sorry this happened to you,” head coach David Trainor said in a statement released on Twitter. “I will do anything in my power to help you, whether it be to find a new program or give you any advice that I can offer.”\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/KJ2jVaP6D0\">pic.twitter.com/KJ2jVaP6D0</a></p>— Akron Zips M Golf (@ZipsMGolf) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZipsMGolf/status/1260976600931336192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 14, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\nThe Zips had just one senior on their 2019-20 roster, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/23628/Mitchell-McFarland?p=1\">Mitchell McFarland</a>. The rest of the team was comprised of three freshmen, two sophomores, and two juniors. The seven non-seniors will have to find a new home, and quickly as right now the fall golf season is still on as scheduled.\r\n\r\nThe NCAA is still requiring member institutions to have 16 varsity level sports available to student-athletes but is offering one-off waivers on a case-by-case basis as schools are facing a crisis previously unseen. With revenue sports like football and men’s/women’s basketball at the forefront of everyone’s minds when it comes to the NCAA’s decision making during the pandemic, Olympic and non-revenue sports like golf are falling victim to budget cuts.\r\n\r\nAkron not only cut the men’s golf program but also men’s cross country and women’s tennis. By eliminating the three athletics programs as well as other undisclosed cuts throughout the school, Akron trimmed $4.4 million from its budget as the school is in the process of lopping off $65 million from its $325 million budget by the end of June.\r\n\r\n“Akron is a special place. It’s a good place,” Trainor told Golf Channel’s, Brentley Romine. “I appreciated my time at Akron. I appreciated the people, the administration, everybody involved with that university; it was all first class.”",

    "articleText": "Reluctantly, the USGA announced the cancellation of another four amateur national championships, leaving just four on the schedule for 2020 as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to disrupt the major amateur golf calendar.\r\n\r\n\"We went into this trying to do everything we could to crown every champion that we could,\" said John Bodenhamer, the USGA’s senior managing director of championships.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nInstead, 10 of the 14 USGA championships have now been cancelled. The latest: the U.S. Mid-Amateur, the U.S. Women's Mid-Amateur, the U.S. Senior, and the U.S. Women's Senior.\r\n\r\nThe USGA previously announced the cancellation of the U.S. Amateur Four-Ball, U.S. Women's Amateur Four-Ball, U.S. Senior Open, U.S. Senior Women’s Open, U.S. Girls' Junior and U.S. Junior Amateur.\r\n\r\nWhat remains on the schedule are the USGA's four oldest national championships: the U.S. Open, U.S. Amateur and U.S. Women's Amateur, all started in 1895; and the U.S. Women's Open, first played in 1946.\r\n\r\nBoth Opens were rescheduled from their original dates, with the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26029/U-S--Open-rescheduled-for-September--two-other-Opens-cancelled\">men moving to September</a> and the women moving to December.\r\n\r\n<b>All USGA qualifying cancelled</b>\r\n\r\nThe USGA also announced that all qualifying for the four remaining championships has been cancelled as well. Instead, each field will be comprised entirely of exempt players.\r\n\r\nThis means that each Open will not truly be \"open\" in 2020. The complete list of exemption categories will be worked out (importantly, there will be exemptions for amateurs).\r\n\r\n\"This is a decision that was exceptionally difficult\", said Bodenhamer. \"The openness of our championships is our DNA—10,000 people following their dream.\"\r\n\r\n\"We take great pride in the fact that many thousands typically enter to pursue their dream of qualifying for a USGA championship and we deeply regret that they will not have that opportunity this year. But this structure provides the best path forward for us to conduct these championships in 2020.\"\r\n\r\nUltimately, the challenge of hosting qualifying in 50 states, as well as foreign countries, each of whom faces a different set of restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic, combined with the strain on golf courses and associations caused by the shutdown, forced the USGA's hand.\r\n\r\nNot that they didn't try their hardest, deliberating for eight weeks.\r\n\r\n\"We turned over every stone we could. We looked at every scenario. Getting to where we got was a long, difficult journey,\" said Bodenhamer. \"What we’re up against with the health and safety of those who host our championships and those who play in them, we just felt we had no choice.\"",

His home club, Nashville Golf & Athletic Club, stayed open minus the driving range which allowed Terry to focus on his short game over the past few months.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith a spur-of-the-moment trip to Iowa, Terry found himself leading the Tri-State Masters after 36 holes. With an opening 68 (-4) and a second-round 67 (-5), Terry was in the final group on a wet, chilly Sunday.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith a three-shot lead to start the day, Terry was focused on the course while paying close attention to the three competitors in his group. With a three-putt bogey on the opening hole, Terry bounced back immediately with a birdie on the second. Terry’s approach shot on the par-five sixth was nowhere to be found.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I feel like I got a pretty bad break here,” Terry said. “I was in the middle of the fairway on the par-five sixth. I hit my second shot just a little left of the green at this left greenside bunker and I had to draw it around a tree so I couldn’t quite see it come down but it wasn’t any more than 10-yards left of the pin.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter taking a lost ball and replaying his approach shot, Terry finished the sixth with a double-bogey seven. <br><br>\r\n\r\nUnbeknownst to him, Adam Fields was making a surge from six-shots back in the group ahead of him.<br><br>\r\n\r\nPlaying the rest of the round at one-under-par, Terry finished the final-round with a two-over-par 74, Terry was two shots clear of everyone but Fields.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter grinding out a tough 18, Terry was let down when he found out he was in a playoff. <br><br>\r\n\r\n“I didn’t really think I was going to be in a playoff, honestly,” Terry said.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAfter having to refocus and decompress after such a tough round he was on the ninth tee ready to face off against the hot-hand of the day, Fields.<br><br>\r\n\r\nUnable to shake loose the previous 18-holes, Terry finished his day the same way he began with a three-putt bogey, losing to Fields who tapped in for par on the first playoff hole.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs for what’s next for Terry, he plans to play in the Greystone Open in Tennessee the first week of June. That tournament -- in a throwback to the Hale America Open won by Ben Hogan during WWII -- has become the pseudo-Tennesse Amateur Championship after that event was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter that, Terry will head back to his hometown of Evansville, Indiana for an invitational before playing in the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/7830/The-Sizzler-Amateur\">Sizzler Amateur</a> in Arizona and potentially the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/1757/North-and-South-Men-s-Amateur-Championship\">North & South Amateur</a> at Pinehurst.",

The tournament was scheduled to be played July 6-10 at Windsong Farm Golf Club near Minneapolis.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe news comes just two days after the the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26067/There-are-now-only-4-USGA-championships-left-in-2020\">USGA announced that the men's and women's U.S. Mid-Amateur and Senior Amateur championships would be cancelled</a>, leaving just four 2020 tournaments on the USGA calendar this year.<br><br>\r\nThe decision by the Trans-Miss Golf Association is certainly not a surprise given the state of our world right now. But for the mostly collegiate field looking to up their status in the WAGR rankings (and just to get out and compete after a shortened college season) the news will come as a big blow.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis year's Trans-Miss was slated to be the 117th playing, making it one of the oldest tournaments in the United States. Past champions include Jack Nicklaus, and more recently Bryson Dechambeau.<br><br>\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD><br>\r\n“The Trans-Mississippi Board of Directors and leadership at Windsong Farm Golf Club are truly disappointed about not being about to host the Championship, but the safety of the players, volunteers and staff was the driving factor in the decision,\" said Trans-Miss President Robert McDonald III in an official release. \"What we know today will certainly be different tomorrow and what things look like in July is any one’s guess” \r\n<br><br>\r\nRELATED: See a full list of <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26004/List-of-amateur-tournaments-affected-by-the-coronavirus-outbreak\">tournaments effected by the COVID-19 pandemic</a>\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe Trans-Mississippi Golf Association has conducted the Championship since 1901 and has provided a national stage for players across the country to showcase their skills on some of the finest clubs across the country. <br><br>\r\n\r\n“The ability to conduct an event in a manner that meets the highest standards of player experience was one that we just felt would be hard to do considering what could be restrictive beyond just the golf,” said TMGA Executive Director Rob Addington. <br><br>\r\n\r\n“Windsong Farm Golf Club is a wonderful test of golf and will be a truly special place to conduct the event,\" continued Addington. \"The TMGA will work with the club to bring the Championship back to Windsong Farm Golf Club and the great state of Minnesota.”<br><br>\r\nWith the cancellation of their second of three events, the Trans-Miss Golf Association still has one left on the calendar -- <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/1305/Trans-Mississippi-Four-Ball-Championship-\">The Trans-Miss Four Ball</a>.

    "teaser": "With four tournaments left on the 2020 calendar, you might think COVID-19 had sapped the USGA of its strength. Think again.",
    "articleText": "The USGA announced on May 18 that their championship schedule for 2020 <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26067/There-are-now-only-4-USGA-championships-left-in-2020\">has been shortened to just four championships</a>. The U.S. Open, U.S. Amateur, U.S. Women's Amateur, and the U.S. Women’s Open are the only championships that remain out of the 14 which the USGA normally hosts each year.<br><br>\r\n\r\nUSGA president <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/5157/Stuart-Francis\">Stuart Francis</a> sat down to chat via Zoom with our own Pete Wlodkowski to discuss the current state of affairs the USGA, as the governing body of golf, is dealing with.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSee below:<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0lvFsjbFX7Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Interview Highlights</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n“Somebody asked me the other day ‘How’s your term going?' said Francis, now serving the first year of a three year term. \"I said 'well all I’m doing so far is I’ve been on a couple conference calls at a minimum every day, dealing with the setbacks, the changes every three or four days, and so far essentially all we’ve done is cancel championships.' But, I do think we’re doing the right thing.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe decision to cancel 10 of the 14 championships was not an easy one.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“We realized that to ask the allied golf associations (AGA's) around the country to commit today to conduct 100 plus qualifiers for the US Am, the US Open and the Women’s Amateur and the Women’s Open was just a very large ridge that was challenging for them,” Francis said. “Each of the AGA's have also delayed many of their championships. We would have had to condense a whole series of qualifiers in a very short period of time. Our overall goal is to conduct great championships and we just didn’t feel like we could do that in terms of doing qualifying and conducting another 8-10 championships this year so that’s why we made the decision we did.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith no traditional qualifying for the four remaining championships, the USGA is putting the revamped World Amateur Golf Ranking (WAGR) to the test. Francis feels as though the WAGR is a solid representation of who would have the best shot of qualifying in a traditional setting but also stated that the WAGR will not be the sole decider in who is in and who is out.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“We’re going to try to replicate the field we might have been able to achieve had we conducted a regular, rigorous qualifying schedule,” said Francis. “We won’t be able to do a perfect job of that, but we’ll be able to do a job that’s highly representative that we would’ve gotten beforehand.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the outlook on next year’s championships, Francis is highly optimistic that the USGA will be able to conduct traditional qualifying and traditional championships “assuming we have, and the various governmental entities have and rely on expert medical opinions and advice that COVID-19 hasn’t returned in force, or is under control, or the social distancing models work, and/or there’s a vaccine.”<br><br>\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nFrancis is very complimentary of the golf industry and golfers across the nation who have taken the utmost precaution during the pandemic while keeping the game alive. Asked if the USGA had a crystal ball when changing the flagstick rule, Francis said:<br><br>\r\n\r\n“Let’s put it this way; I don’t think we or anyone else predicted a pandemic and the ramifications which have flown through the world. But, we were happy to embark upon the rules of modernization project a number of years ago and we think after people had a period of time to adjust to them, which always takes a little bit of time, everybody has reasonably embraced almost every change we made, and I do think they have been for the good of the game.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nBelieving that golf can be looked at as a positive recreational activity while safely socially distancing, Francis says that golf has been very diligent on following guidelines and rules laid out by both federal and state agencies. And he left us on with a golf metaphor we are going to adopt as our COVID-19 mantra:<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"Let's hope that as a country, and as a world, COVID-19 turned out to be a tee shot deep into the woods,\" said Francis. \"But we're chipping out to the fairway and their's still a lot of golf left to play.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nAmen.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs for now, the four remaining championships will take place as follows.

    "articleText": "Down two shots to defending champ, Scottie Scheffler to start the day, Brandon Wu shot a final round 66 (-6) at the Maridoe Samaritan Fund Invitational on Thursday.\r\n\r\nWu, a Stanford alum and current Korn Ferry Tour member, pulled away from Scheffler who was plagued by a handful of bogeys on the day, including a double on the par-four fifth. Wu kept Scheffler at bay with three birdies on the final five holes.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nWu turned pro last year after finishing his amateur career with a series of bangs. He helped the Cardinal <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/23926/Stanford-prevails-in-NCAA-match-play-marathon\">win the NCAA Championship</a>, after which he became the first player in 50 years to open qualify for both the U.S. and British Opens.

With an opening 34, Coody could muster just one birdie on the backside before giving it right back on the 18th hole to finish at 11-under-par in solo third with a final round 70 (-2).\r\n\r\nCoody was seven shots clear of the next amateur, Baylor’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/17277/Cooper-Dossey?p=1\">Cooper Dossey</a>. Dossey finished the event with an even-par 70 in a tie for eighth place at four-under alongside for Oklahoma State stand out Zach Bauchou and PGA Tour regular Sebastian Munoz.\r\n\r\nThe Maridoe Samaritan Fund Invitational ‘2.0’ came just 19 days after the first event to help out of work caddies. Both events drew in high-level talent as the PGA Tour plans to make a comeback next month and most amateur tournaments scheduled to take place have been canceled or postponed. Wu will get to pick a charity of his choosing to share in his winnings.\r\n\r\n<i>ROUND TWO RECAP</i>\r\n\r\nJust over two weeks since the last Maridoe Samaritan Fund Invitational (MSFI), Scottie Scheffler is in position to defend his title.\r\n\r\nThe MSFI ‘2.0’ as it’s been coined is a hotbed of talent from both the pro and amateur ranks as one of the best fields during COVID-19. The first Invitational was a charity event benefiting caddies out of work due to the pandemic, but this go around the winner will get to share their winnings with a charity of their choice.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nScheffler won the first MFSI on April 30 by one stroke with a nine-under score through 54-holes. Shooting a 67 (-5)  on Tuesday and a 66 (-6) on Wednesday, Scheffler is the leader at nine-under, tying his winning score, through 36-holes with one round remaining.\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26054/Scottie-Scheffler-wins-Maridoe-Invitational\">Scottie Scheffler wins Maridoe Invitational</a>\r\n\r\nUniversity of Texas sophomore <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22034/Parker-Coody?p=1\">Parker Coody</a> is just one shot back of Scheffler with a 70 (-2) on Tuesday and a 66 (-6) on Wednesday.

    "articleText": "At a time when major amateur events are leaving the 2020 calendar, the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/9290/Savannah-Quarters-Invitational\">Savannah Quarters Invitational</a> is hoping to fill the void and establish itself as the next big tournament for national-level competitive amateurs.\r\n\r\nJoey Kalbac won the inaugural event last July. As the defending club champion at Savannah Quarters, Kalbac had plenty of pressure to defend the club from the non-members in the field.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“Everyone looked at me -- ‘are you going to represent the club and go out there and win it?’” Kalbac told AmateurGolf.com. “I almost didn’t but I did. It came down to the last couple of holes and I had to make a late charge but I was able to do it.”\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00060634.jpg\"></div></div>Kalbac has high regard for the course as he would put the club’s four par threes against any other set of par threes in the region. Three of the four play near or over 200 yards from the championship tees with an iconic island green on No. 15 that plays 137 yards.\r\n\r\n“It can make things very interesting down the stretch,” Kalbac said regarding No. 15.\r\n\r\nAs is typical for Greg Norman-designed courses, there are two driveable par-fours (No. 8 and No. 11) which play a touch over 310 yards from the tips. Both green complexes are heavily protected with bunkers to make for true risk-reward shots on the tee.\r\n\r\nKalbac, a Miami, Florida native, and accomplished junior golfer, turned down a golf scholarship at North Carolina’s Lamar College and went to the University of Alabama to pursue a degree in engineering. He now works as a mechanical engineer and while hitting the links on the weekends as he is recently married and has a child on the way.\r\n\r\nHe will be back to defend his title in July against a top field, hoping to go 2-for-2 and keep the trophy at home for another year.",

In November of 2018, Woods and Mickelson put it all on the line for bragging rights and over $9 million, which Mickelson won in an unconventional playoff.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThis time around, there will be challenges such as a one-club hole on No. 5, a par-four, as well as side betting among the teams. The front nine will be a traditional team stroke-play match outside of No. 5. The back nine will be a modified alternate shot format which allows all four to tee off on each hole and play alternate shot from their chosen tee shot.\r\n\r\nWoods holds an advantage over Mickelson as the event is taking place at Woods’ home course, Medalist. However, Mickelson has let the media and fans know that playing at Woods’ home track does not mean much to him.\r\n\r\nWith a mic’d up foursome, similar to what fans saw last Sunday during the #DrivingRelief match between Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler, and Matthew Wolff, the two teams have enough rapport with each other for fans to hear some great banter they can take to their weekend matches in the future.\r\n\r\nOn the gridiron, Brady leads Manning in head-to-head wins boasting an 11-6 record but Manning holds a 3-2 advantage in the playoffs.\r\n\r\nAs for Woods and Mickelson, Woods holds an 18-15-4 record when the iconic duo are paired together. Mickelson has played second-fiddle to Woods’ dominance over the past 20+ years as Woods’ 15 career-majors are second-most all-time. Mickelson is still in high company with five majors over his career.\r\n\r\nHOW TO WATCH:\r\n\r\nWhen: 3p.m. Eastern\r\n\r\nWhere: TNT, TBS, truTV, HLN\r\n\r\nCommentators: Brian Anderson, Trevor Immelman, Amanda Balionis, Charles Barkley, Justin Thomas",

    "articleText": "Many amateur tournaments have had their consecutive years played streak snapped due to COVID-19, but that was not the case for the 33rd annual Southwick Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\n“We had the Graham City Am last month, I think we were the only people to have a tournament in the month of April,” Tony Byerly said in an interview with AmateurGolf.com. “We were going to do anything we could to make sure the tournament didn’t get cancelled.”\r\n\r\nByerly, president of Byerley Management Group LLC and the general manager of Southwick Golf Course in Graham, North Carolina picked up his eighth Southwick Amateur Championship on Sunday.\r\n\r\nCOVID-19 was not the only threat to the tournament as the course was pounded with over seven inches of rain just days before the tournament, washing out holes 14 and 15. Byerly’s grounds crew worked hard to prepare the course adding an additional longer tee box to No. 1 so players could play No. 1 and No. 2 again in place of the par-five 14th and par-four 15th.\r\n\r\nSitting in a tie for third place following the first round with a 67 (-4) on Saturday, Byerly went on a tear on Sunday posting a nine-under 62 in the second to last group.\r\n\r\n“With this being my home course I play it really well, but I didn’t putt really well the first day,” Byerly said. “I was trying to make as many birdies as I could.”\r\n\r\nWith nine birdies and an eagle, Byerly had just two bogeys dirty his scorecard, keeping him from tying the course record of 60 that he shot in 2008. Not only does Byerly hold the course record at Southwick, but he also holds the lowest tournament score of 126 with a 64, 62.\r\n\r\nAt age 46, Byerly has hundreds of amateur tournament wins. Turning pro in 1999, he held professional status on multiple tours until regaining his amateur status in 2006. Byerly has aspirations of joining the PGA Champions Tour once eligible when he turns 50. Adopting Fred Couples’ laid-back playing style, that may not be such a stretch.\r\n\r\n“That’s my goal if I can stay healthy,” Byerly said about trying to qualify for the Champions Tour. “I don’t practice a lot but I go out and play tournaments and play great.”",

Combine those with soft feel from the 8620 carbon steel construction and Callaway feels that they have maximized their ability to spin the ball.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTouring pros prefer the raw-steel finish because of reduced glare, the \"rusted\" look that emerges with exposure to air and moisture, and because the raw steel hides the marks usually left behind when a grinding wheel is used to adjust the club by removing material from the heel, toe, or flange.<br><br>\r\n\r\nCallaway is offering the JAWS MD5 Raw wedges in four sole configurations:<br><br>\r\n\r\nC – A moderately wide sole with relief in the heel and toe areas. (62 degrees)<br><br>\r\n\r\nS – A standard, straight and versatile sole for players who rarely open the club face. (50-60 degrees)<br><br>\r\n\r\nX – A high-bounce version of the C Grind for players who have a steeper angle of attack into the ball. (54-60 degrees)<br><br>\r\n\r\nT – A new option for recreational players, the T grind has a crescent-shaped sole and a thicker topline that elevates the center of gravity and makes it easier to flight approach shots down. (58 and 60 degrees)<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Callaway JAWS MD5 Raw wedges are available June 4 for a retail price of $159.99 each. Available in even lofts from 50 to 62 degrees for right-handed players; 52, 56 and 60 degrees for left-handed players.",

Hebert, a three-time All-American selection for the Longhorns in his playing days, is in his sixth full-time season with Texas.

Jay also captained the 1971 Ryder Cup team.\r\n\r\n\"Big thanks to TaylorMade Golf and to our Association for their support of this award, and big thanks to Coach Fields for the opportunity, the trust, and for allowing me to be myself on a daily basis,\" Hebert said.",

    "articleText": "The Durango Amateur Championship played at Hillcrest Golf Club in Durango, Colorado was held with COVID-19 precautions over Memorial Day weekend. Cory Gillespie, a recent graduate of LeTourneau University, took home the win in his hometown.\r\n\r\nGillespie was in a tie for fourth place following Sunday’s breezy first round, posting a 7-over 78. With the leaders at 1-over, Gillespie had plenty of ground to cover on Monday. Paired with his former high school assistant coach Kermitt Barrett for the final round, Gillespie went on a tear, posting six birdies in the final round.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“I have never seen him play so steady,” Barrett told the Durango Harold.\r\n\r\nMaking the turn at 2-under on the day, Gillespie made easy work of the back nine with birdies on 11, 15, and 18 on his way to a one-shot win in the gross net portion and a six-shot win in the championship flight.\r\n\r\nWhile in high school Gillespie battled seizures, a knee injury that required surgery, as well as overcoming Tommy John surgery before landing at LeTourneau in Texas.\r\n\r\nOvercoming all of that, Gillespie had a quiet collegiate career before the COVID-19 pandemic ended his senior season abruptly. He plans on taking advantage of the NCAA’s decision to grant spring sport athletes another year of eligibility so he can finish what he started this past season before he begins his path to a professional golf career.\r\n\r\nWomen’s champion Aimee Fladt cruised to an 18-shot victory with a two-round total of 165.",

    "articleText": "The COVID-19 pandemic could not stop the Lake Creek Amateur from returning after a seven-year hiatus.\r\n\r\nThe tournament, held at Buena Vista University Golf Course in Storm Lake, Iowa -- just an hour east of Sioux City if you're wondering -- played host to 97 amateurs from around the region.\r\n\r\nAfter 36-holes a champion was yet to be named as John Spellerberg, Jack Evans, and Jonny Douglas were tied for first with a two-day total of even-par 144.\r\n\r\nDouglas, a soon to be senior at Morningside College and a Newcastle Upon Tyne, England native fired rounds of 70 and 74. Spellerberg, a Nebraska native and former Creighton University golfer posted 69-75 as windy weather on Sunday sent the leaders' scores north of par. Evans, a soon to be senior on the Sioux Falls University golf team mirrored Spellerberg’s scores.\r\n\r\nEvans snuck his way into the playoff after getting up and down from a short-sided lie behind the green on No. 18.\r\n\r\nHeading back to No. 18, Evans found himself looking straight downwind at a 167 yard approach shot. He hit a 50-degree wedge, setting up a chance for birdie. With the other two players having gimme par putts, Evans holed a 20-foot bender to win the tournament right in front of the clubhouse.\r\n\r\n“It was probably the best stroke I’d hit all day. About 10 feet from the hole I knew it was going in,” said Evans in an AmateurGolf.com interview. \r\n\r\n“From the second we teed off on the opening hole to the final putt in the playoff that was a battle with all three of the guys,” he continued. “It was an up and down day to say the least.”",

    "articleText": "If the end of May is any indication, competitive golf's comeback from the coronavirus pandemic is really taking hold. In Nevada, 36-hole tournaments were played over back-to-back weekends to close out the month.\r\n\r\nThe Nevada Capital City Classic, hosted by Eagle Valley Golf Course, played its part by hosting a solid field just a week after the Boulder City Amateur.\r\n\r\nReno, Nevada native Connor Motherway, who secured a T20 at the AGC Silicon Valley Amateur and a T3 at the McClure Cup earlier this year finally got over the hump with a win at Eagle Valley.\r\n\r\nIn his opening round, Motherway traded three birdies and three bogeys on the front nine for a 36 before catching fire on 10 through 13 with four-straight birdies en route to a 32 giving him a three shot lead after round one.\r\n\r\n“I made a good birdie on 10, made another one on 11, 12 is kind of a gettable par-5, and then I almost made a hole-in-one on 13,” Motherway, an AmateurGolf.com member, said on the phone.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nMotherway posted his second-straight 68 on Sunday but this time with a much cleaner scorecard. Motherway's bogey free final round helped him cruise home with the title at 8-undre 136. He birdied Nos. 5, 8, 11, and 15, then parred in to claim the title by five over Griffin Cooper and Mitchell Cornell. Both players tied for second at 3-under 141. \r\n\r\nNobody else came within 10 shots of the leaders, who teed off knowing someone in their group was going to walk away with the title.\r\n\r\nA freshman on the University of Nevada golf team, Motherway finished the abbreviated NCAA season with a 74.25 scoring average through three events including a season-best 65 at the Wolfpack Shootout in the fall semester.",

    "articleText": "John Hills has been one of the Toledo metro area's top players for decades.\r\n\r\nAfter retiring from a career as a tax and financial consultant last year, Hills turned 65 in April. That's the time many senior amateurs start looking forward to moving over to the Super Senior flight with a little extra spring in their step.\r\n\r\nBut Hills -- the son of legendary golf course architect Arthur Hills, proved Sunday that age is just a number by winning the Great Lakes Spring Classic, an event open to players of all ages.\r\n\r\nPlaying one of his father's course layouts, the Maumee Bay State Park Golf Course, Hills opened with a 4-over 76 on Saturday. He trailed recent Bowling Green State grad (and golf team member) Trey Walker and another former BGSU player (Brian Gerken) by three shots heading into Sunday's final round. \r\n\r\nDespite giving up more than 40 years to Walker, and 30 to Gerken, it was experience and patience and accuracy that won the day on Sunday. The modest champion put it simply.\r\n\r\n\"The course my father designed has a fair amount of heather,\" said Hills. \"I was able to avoid it. The other contenders did not.\"\r\n\r\nHills went out hot on Sunday, posting 2-under 34 on the front nine, and pulled into a tie with Walker -- who shot 37 on the front.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nWith Gerken falling back, it looked to be a tough battle with Hills and Walker heading to the 10th tee. But when Walker took a triple there, Hills took the saddle and never looked back, firing 2-over 38 on the back to Walker's 40 for the two shot win.\r\n\r\nConner Stykemain finished in a three-way tie for third with Brian Simmons and Terry Tyson at 152. He bounced back from an 81 with the low round on Sunday, a 1-under 71 that included an eagle on the par-4 2nd hole, where he drove the green. Stykemain's 10-shot improvement was almost matched by Tyson, who chopped eight off his Saturday 80 with an even par 72. \r\n\r\n",

And with the scores that were posted, one has to marvel at how quickly both Davis and his playoff opponent Gabe Hunter were able to \"shake the rust off.\"\r\n\r\nOr maybe there was never any rust.\r\n\r\nThe 36-hole stroke play championship brought out some of Tennessee’s finest amateur players in the championship, senior, super-senior flights. It was originally scheduled for late April, and postponed due to the pandemic.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nDavis, a 2019 US Mid-Am qualifier, tallied a 5-under 67 on Saturday and added a 68 on Sunday to tie Alcoa’s Gabe Hunter at 9-under 135. Hunter tied Alex Hodge (who finished 5th overall) for Sunday's low round, posting 66.\r\n\r\nBoth players trailed first round leader Braeden Wear, who posted the low round of the tournament at 65 on Saturday. Wear posted a bit less magical, but still very respectable round of 71 on Sunday. He opened the door for Davis and Hunter to fight for the title, while finishing a solid solo third at 8-under.\r\n\r\nIn the Senior Championship, Lenoir City’s Ray Morton took home first-place honors with 3-under 141, four shots clear of the 32-man field.\r\n\r\nSuper-Senior winner David Dooley shot a 145 through 36-holes to stay four shots ahead of the 12-man field.\r\n\r\nIn the Open division Alex Brewer -- playing as a 6-handicap -- won by three shots with a two-day net score of 140.",

    "articleText": "University of North Carolina freshman <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21563/Austin-Greaser?p=1\">Austin Greaser</a> won the 80th Northern Kentucky Amateur Championship on Thursday. The 54-hole event held at Lassing Pointe Golf Course in Union, Kentucky played host to some of the areas best mid-am’s and collegiate players.\r\n\r\nGreaser, from nearby Vandalia, Ohio, took advantage of the first competitive golf he’s played in since the COVID-19 pandemic cut his freshman season short.\r\n\r\n“I worked really hard on my game,” Greaser told AmateurGolf.com. “I worked hard the last three months, looking forward to my first competitive round and I got a chance this week. The hard work came through and treated me well this week.”\r\n\r\nSitting at 4-under through the first two rounds, Greaser shot a tournament-low 6-under 65 on Thursday, clearing the field by six shots and just missed tying the course record of 63.\r\n\r\nGreaser caught fire on the closing nine with four-straight birdies on hole Nos. 12 through 15 before capping off the tournament with a birdie on the par-4 18th. \r\n\r\nTournament director Kevin Stanton of the Greater Cincinnati Golf Association said that the field was one of the deepest and most competitive fields in recent history. As we have discussed in our article about the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26055/The-return-of-the-state-am-\">Return of the State Amateur</a>, players not traveling to cancelled tournaments are staying closer to home and playing state and regional events.\r\n\r\nWith 3-under winning last year’s tournament, Stanton was impressed with the Tar Heel’s performance.\r\n\r\n“He [Greaser] set the tone,” Stanton said. “10-under is really balling. He played really well.”\r\n\r\nBehind Greaser was a pair of Cincinnati Bearcats. Freshman <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/25682/Ty-Gingerich?p=1\">Ty Gingerich</a> finished in solo second at 3-under just ahead of Bearcat teammate junior <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/23974/Joe-McCarthy?p=1\">Joe McCarthy</a> who finished at 1-under-par.\r\n\r\nWith tournament golf opening back up, Greaser expects to keep the momentum going over the summer before heading back to Chapel Hill in August.",

    "articleText": "Oklahoma’s top junior golfers took to Kickingbird Golf Course in Edmond, Oklahoma for the Oklahoma Golf Association’s Junior Championship. While taking COVID-19 precautions in the clubhouse, the OGA and Kickingbird allowed the tournament to be played ‘regularly’ with normal cups and allowing the flagstick to be taken out.\r\n\r\n“I give the OGA a lot of credit,” Oklahoma Christian School head coach Tosh Hays told AmateurGolf.com. “Last week we did not take the pins out of the holes. We required everyone to putt with the flags in.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHays got to see the future of his boys golf program take center stage as Ryder Cowan bested his OCS teammate Bryant Polhill in the 14-15 boys championship. Both Cowan and Polhill finished their freshman year at OCS and played just one tournament before the COVID-19 ended their season.\r\n\r\nPolhill had a one-hole advantage on 10 of the first 14 holes with Cowan staying well within striking range. Tied on the 17th tee, Cowan took his first lead of the match with a par countering Polhill’s bogey. Not looking back, Cowan closed out the match with a birdie on 18 to win 2UP on his teammate.\r\n\r\n“I was just so proud of them,” Hays said. “The way they were representing themselves, the school, it was such a great match.”\r\n\r\nEdmond North senior and Texas Tech commit James ‘JP’ Roller beat red-hot Oklahoma commit Drew Goodman 4&2 to capture the 16-18 boys championship. Prior to the championship match, Goodman was 20-under for the tournament which included a six-under performance through 17 holes in his 3&1 semifinal win. \r\n\r\nRoller and Goodman dueled for much of the front nine before Roller fired a dart from 187-yards to four-feet on the par-5 ninth tapping in for eagle and taking a 2UP advantage before making the turn.\r\n\r\nTrading blows but not allowing Goodman to make up too much ground, Roller had a 3UP advantage heading to the par-3 16th. Hitting his tee shot to 20-feet, Goodman cleaned up a par before conceding the match to Roller who had a four-footer for birdie.\r\n\r\nWith his senior season cut short, Roller said the win over his friend in the championship meant “a lot” to him. Surely the duo will get the opportunity to play each other again as they are heading to rival Big 12 schools. \r\n\r\nIn the girls division, Edmond North senior Emily Miller got one last junior golf win at her home course. Never making it past the first round of match play in her career, Miller found herself matched up with the No. 1 seed and good friend, Maddi Kamas in the championship match.\r\n\r\n1UP at the turn, Miller kicked it into gear on the back nine, quickly building a 3UP lead through 12 holes. Cutting the lead back down to 2UP, Kamas ran out of holes before falling to Miller 2&1.\r\n\r\n“I knew she [Kamas] was going to be really tough to beat,” Miller said. “I just kept trying to make putts, keep my head on, and stay steady.”\r\n\r\nMiller is committed to playing at the University of Central Oklahoma where she has high aspirations for herself and her future team.\r\n\r\n“My goal is to take UCO to the national championship and compete as a team and hopefully win there.”",

If that wasn't enough, he made his third career hole-in-one on the par-3 14th hole. He came back with a 70 and was only trailing by one despite Humphries posting a 64 of his own in the second round.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAmateurGolf.com is definitely adding Zou to our \"must watch\" list.",

    "articleText": "Winning your city championship. Sounds nice doesn't it?\r\n\r\nOn Sunday in Salt Lake City, resident Blake Tomlinson was standing on the 8th tee after making back-to-back bogeys and with the damp and windy weather worsening. But that wind was at his back. And while the hole measures 358 yards, the altitude of 4200 feet makes the green even more reachable.\r\n\r\n“I just knew I needed to step up and hit a good drive,” he told the Salt Lake City Tribune. “That’s what crossed my mind.”\r\n\r\nWhat crossed his group's other players minds as the drive headed towards the green was that it wasn't just long enough, it was straight enough too.\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So this just happened:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/UtesGolf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@UtesGolf</a> Blake Tomlinson 359-yard par 4 8th, hole-in-one, final round <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SLCGOLF?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SLCGOLF</a> Amateur at Bonneville GC<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/utahgolf?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#utahgolf</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/FAXL4rne9q\">pic.twitter.com/FAXL4rne9q</a></p>— Randy Dodson (@RandyatFairways) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RandyatFairways/status/1269770463590273024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\n\"Go in!\" one of them said, according to Tomlinson. Those are probably the two words you would most like to have your playing partners see after they watch you hit a shot.\r\n\r\nMuch to Tomlinson's disbelief, the ball found the cup and turned his entire day around. A 60-foot birdie putt on No. 9 for a front nine of 32. Three birdies on the back nine against just a single bogey (as the weather got worse) led to a 66 and 5-under tournament total.  \r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nStarting the day four shots behind, Tomlinson hoped his score would hold up, but didn't know just how good a 66 was in Sunday's weather. In fact, he was the only player to break 70.\r\n\r\nIn college tournaments, “I tend to play well in bad weather,” he said, citing “a lot of mental toughness and a lot of faith in my game.”\r\n\r\nThe University of Utah Junior won the 2019 Bandon Dunes Collegiate Championship at 4-under, conquering the typically cool, windy, and occasionally wet Coastal Oregon spring weather.\r\n\r\nDavid Timmins and Tyson Shelley finished two strokes back at 3-under 141. The pair had shared the first-round lead Saturday at 69 with Zach Jones and David Jennings, and again posted the same score (72) on Sunday.\r\n\r\nJones posted a 73 and tied for fourth place with Ute golfer Mitchell Schow (72-70), the 2018 champion. Tomlinson became the third player in history to win both the Salt Lake City Open and Salt Lake City Amateur.\r\n\r\nFor the next year, call him \"City Champ.\"",

Alec fired a two under round today at Lakeshore and had a 279 total for his four rounds. <a href=\"https://t.co/CtAPJEZsAE\">pic.twitter.com/CtAPJEZsAE</a></p>— Central New York PGA (@CNYPGA) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNYPGA/status/1269766760049369088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\nIt was Bard's first time playing in the tournament -- and likely a direct result of the cancellation of the Monroe Invitational scheduled for June 10-14. (It's unlikely Bard would have chosen to play a 72-hole event ending on June 7 and start another 72-hole event on June 10.)\r\n\r\nThe recent Penn State graduate from New Hartford, NY had his season cut short by Coronavirus, but after an NCAA ruling has decided to forgo the job market and head back to play out his last eligible year.\r\n\r\n\"It was really tough out there,\" said Bard in a Central New York PGA interview (see tweet above). \"The wind was whipping the entire day and the pins were really tucked ... I drove it really well and I just tried to hit the center of the greens.\"\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe Bard family name is well known in Central New York. Alec’s older brother, Derek, was a four year golfer at University of Virginia and a standout amateur player who won the 2017 Monroe Invitational and 2015 Sunnehanna Amateur. He played last year on the Korn Ferry Tour.\r\n\r\nAlec Bard won't go down as holding the largest margin of victory in the AIM Post-Standard Championship -- that record was set at 15 shots by Alan Foster in 1986 -- but his 7-under 279 did set the record for the lowest tournament total in history.",

Coming back on Saturday, House was quickly in the hole against Davidson University freshman, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/27399/Brian-Garrett?p=1\">Brian Garrett</a>. Down four holes at the turn, House never thought he was out of the match.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nClawing his way back to all-square, House flared his drive well right on the 18th hole.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t too happy and hit my driver on the ground and the shaft ended up breaking,” House said.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter finding his ball with the search clock winding down, House gave himself an opportunity to make something happen after advancing the ball forward. With Garrett in with a par, House clutched up and sunk a 25-footer to extend the match into extra holes. Heading to No. 10 where House began his comeback, he won the match to advance.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the quarterfinal match, House faced off against his Roadrunner teammate, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/170221/Hunter-Bott\">Hunter Bott</a>, who gave him a new driver shaft before their afternoon match.

With wins on eight and nine, the duo pushed holes 10-12 before Adams conceded the 13th to go 1UP with five to play. After a birdie to make it all-square through 15, the fun began for House.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“It was anyone’s ballgame at that point, with three to go,” House said.<br><br>\r\n\r\nUp one on 16, House missed a championship-clinching putt on 17 before chipping in on 18 for eagle with a walk-off win over Adams.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“It [this win] does a lot for my confidence. Over the last four months, since this corona stuff hit, it made me realize what I want to do with my life... I’ve really put my head down over the last four months,” said House. “It feels really good to see the results showing.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nTaking advantage of the NCAA granting another year of eligibility to spring athletes, House will attempt to qualify for the PGA LatinoAmerica and PGA Mackenzie Tours this winter before wrapping up his final season with the Roadrunners.",

    "teaser": "In the playoff, Peter Barron of Mays Landing, NJ chipped in to defeat Dawson Jones, Eric Lefante after all tied at 2-under 140",
    "articleText": "There are some beautiful and prestigious clubs in New York and New Jersey. Many of them take turns in the host rotation of Metropolitan Golf Association or New Jersey G.A. events. \r\n\r\nBut hosting annual tournaments on weekends is difficult for these clubs due to the short golf season, so another type of annual event has become popular — the one day 27 or 36 hole medal play championship. Depending on the weather and course setup, these events will really test the best players. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately one of the gems of the one-day bunch -- <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/3723/Hochster-Memorial-Invitational-CANCELLED\">The Hochster Memorial at Quaker Ridge</a> scheduled for June 22 -- was cancelled due to coronavirus, but the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/6655/Arcola-Cup\">Arcola Cup at Arcola Country Club</a> is still on the calendar for July, and the Eagle Oaks Invitational was played today with safety measures in place.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful New Jersey day, and a field of 72 primarily Mid-Amateur players teed it up at Eagle Oaks for their 36-hole Invitational. I spoke to longtime New Jersey Mid-Amateur standout Michael Stamberger about the tournament, which was headed for a three-way playoff.\r\n\r\n\"It was a little different,\" said Stamberger. \"We were asked to wear masks before entering the clubhouse, and the regular luncheon between rounds turned into box lunches in the carts.\"\r\n\r\nBut, according to Stamberger, single rider carts took 1/2 hour off each round. And the Eagle Oaks was one of the first tournaments we know of to implement a suggestion I made in my article <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26058/Golf-Tournament-Best-Practices-for-COVID-19-Safety\">Tournament Best Practices for COVID-19 Safety</a> -- they gave each golfer their own sanitized rake to place in their individual cart. \r\n\r\nStamberger posted 74-72 - not his best golf but certainly a respectable top-10 showing that put him in front of many top players, including former Met Amateur champ Matthew Mattare. Mattare shook his morning rust off (an 80) by improving a full 12 shots in the afternoon, with a 3-under 68 in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nJim Dufficy of Tinton Falls, NJ did Mattare three better on the improvement front, posting 81-66 after opening the afternoon with birdies on five of the first seven holes. (Three in a row on Hole Nos. 2-4 and back-to-back on Nos. 6 and 7.) Not giving up after taking a double on the par-3 11th, Dufficy eagled the 17th and parred No. 18 to post the low round of the day, and the biggest round to round improvement - 15 strokes.  \r\n\r\nWe're not sure what was in that box lunch, but Dufficy must have liked it.\r\n\r\nThe three-way playoff was decided in a hurry, as Peter Barron of Mays Landing, NJ chipped in on No. 18 to defeat Dawson Jones (Howell, NJ) and Eric Lefante (Bedminster, NJ). \r\n\r\nBarron is a member of Galloway National who often plays in Philadelphia area events, but wins his fair share in New Jersey as well. His past titles include the 2014 Philadelphia Mid-Am, the 2016 Delaware Open (as an amateur) and the 2017 New Jersey Mid-Am. \r\n\r\nStamberger, who played both rounds with Barron, said that the biggest difference in Barron's morning 73 and his afternoon bogey-free 67 was the driver. \r\n\r\n\"Peter played great in the afternoon,\" said Stamberger. \"He started driving it dead straight, and much longer than he did in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nBarron also won the tournament in 2015, posting 6-over 148. But the weather that day was nothing like today -- 48 degrees with 20mph wind gusts. That's the difference in an April and June tournament date in New Jersey.",

The Chino Hills, California native finished the year ranked No. 3 in the Golfweek/AmateurGolf.com World Amateur Ranking, No. 3 in the World Amateur Golf Ranking, No. 5 in the Scratch Players World Amateur Ranking and was a PING First-Team All-American.\r\n\r\nAs the Hogan values amateur play as much as collegiate play, Theegala advanced to the 2019 match play portion of the U.S. Amateur and the Western Amateur. With a second-place finish at the 2019 Sahalee Players Amateur, a 12th place finish at the Sunnehanna, a win at the 2020 Master of the Amateurs in Australia, and a pair of collegiate wins to boot, Theegala was chosen over Vanderbilt senior <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18421/John-Augenstein?p=1\">John Augenstein</a> and Florida freshman <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/63762/Ricky-Castillo\">Ricky Castillo</a>.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“To me, the scope of his competitive success represents what the Ben Hogan Award is all about,” AmateurGolf.com CEO Pete Wlodkowski said.

Closing her first-round, Bae carded a 5-under 67 with five birdies through the first six holes of the back nine. Simmering down on No. 16, Bae posted a double-bogey on the par-4 but followed it up with a birdie on 18 to sit just two-shots back of former Furman standout and current Symetra Tour player <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/15200/Taylor-Totland?p=1\">Taylor Totland</a> after Monday’s opening round.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nNot to be outdone by Bae, Shepherd fired an opening 68 that featured a one-under front side and a nice string of three consecutive birdies on holes 13 through 15 to post an opening 68 in a four-way tie for third place.\r\n\r\n“On 15 I hit a wayward drive and had to punch out,” Shepherd told AmateurGolf.com. “I had 170 in and hit a really nice punch 6-iron and hit the pin on the second hop for an unconventional birdie which was kind of nice.”\r\n\r\nThe second and final day of the Open brought low scores once again as Bae strung together three birdies on holes 14 through 16 before making a bogey on 18 for an even 34/34 split, good enough for second place and a tournament field low 15 birdies.\r\n\r\nBeginning the day three shots off the lead, Shepherd pieced together her own birdie run on holes 13 through 15 in hopes of tracking down Totland. To no avail, she closed the tournament with a final-round 69 in solo third-place.\r\n\r\nAlthough not coming away with the win, Shepherd is quite pleased with her performance against a field of professionals.\r\n\r\n“It kind of validates the work I’m putting in.

It was supposed to be there this year, but two weeks ago Trump Charlotte decided to not allow them to play so they came back and asked us at Irish Creek if we would host it again. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Carolinas PGA section came down last Wednesday to mark the golf course and get ready for the tournament. On Thursday they found out one of their staff had tested positive for COVID-19. They all had to quarantine.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSo they called the Carolinas Golf Association, Executive Director Jack Nance and Jason Cox said they would run it. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe rules officials were not part of the section staff so they were OK. They asked me to come in and do all the scoring. It went off without a hitch. It just shows how well golf organizations and the people in golf stick together.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe other thing that has been really neat is the way we are doing scoring. They are handed a scorecard of one of the players in their group on the first tee and they keep that score all the way. When they get to the scoring area they each read out the scores from their card. I entered them directly in Blue Golf on my laptop which the screen duplicated to a television next to me. They look at the screen verify that all of the numbers are correct and when they all agree I press save and that is them signing their card. We then have them throw all the cards in a box and save them as back up. It is the most efficient scoring I have ever done. No group has been here for more than three minutes.</i><br><br>\r\n\r\nPlayers were given a set of guidelines in advance of the tournament about how to use the practice range, how early to arrive, and other social-distancing specific rules and advisories for the tournament. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<B>RESULTS</B><BR><BR>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00060614.jpg\"><br>Kelly Mitchum (Carolinas PGA photo)</div></div>Prior to this week, the amateurs have taken it to the pros at the North Carolina Open for four of the last five years, after amateur Jake McGlone lost in a playoff in 2014. College coach Justin Tereshko won in 2015, am David Kocher won back-to-back titles in 2016 and 2017, and Patrick Cover took the title in 2018. Their streak was broken in 2019, by Ryan Tyndall of the Reserve Golf Club in South Carolina.<br><br>\r\n\r\nJust a shot back that year? PGA Professional Kelly Mitchum of Pinehurst. <br><br>\r\n\r\nTuesday, Mitchum came our on top at 10-under-par, recording 11 birdies and just one bogey for the 36-hole event. But the amateurs still did very, very well.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMitchum is well decorated in the Carolinas, having won the Carolinas Open twice and being named Bob Boyd Player of the Year seven times. He adds his first North Carolina Open trophy to his trophy case, and can thank the Carolinas Golf Association for rallying their troops and stepping in for the Carolinas PGA.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>AMATEUR FINISHES</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nTying the low round of the tournament (a bogey free 65) amateur Peter Fountain of Raleigh, NC finished with a 36-hole total of 8-under-par to finish two shots behind Mitchum in second place. Mitchum is headed to University of North Carolina Chapel Hill this fall and has a bright collegiate career ahead of him, no matter when they get started competing.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAmateur Blake Taylor (Atkinson, NC) carded a 36-total of 6-under-par to finish T3 with Steve Scott (The Outpost Club), Cory Schneider (The Pointe GC). It was another close call for Taylor, who finished tied for second with Mitchum in 2019. He recently concluded his senior year at East Carolina University.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOther amateurs finishing in the top 10 included Ethan Hall of Morehead City, NC and Walker Cress of Concord, NC. The pair finished T6 at 5-under Rounding out the top ten is amateur Patrick Stephenson (Four Oaks, NC) who shot two solid rounds of 69 to finish at 4-under-par for the championship.\r\n",

With birdies on No. 10 and No. 15 once again, Morgan was 3-under for the championship and took a one-shot lead into the final round.\r\n\r\nMorgan’s final round was a roller coaster, to say the least. Back-to-back bogeys kicked off her day, cutting her lead to one before back-to-back birdies on holes three and four negated her slow start. Adding a birdie on seven, Morgan seemed to have forgot about what happened to begin the day. Suddenly, the wheels came off. Morgan carded four consecutive bogeys on No. 8, 9, 10, and 11. Snapping out of the bogey trance, Morgan fired a birdie on No. 12 and parred the next five holes.\r\n\r\nOn 18, still with a one-shot lead, all Morgan had to do was make it six straight holes with a par to close out the championship. But, just like last week, Morgan had a flair for the dramatic. Making a bogey on the 54th hole, she found herself limping into a playoff against Furman commit <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/117243/Savannah-Hylton\">Savannah Hylton</a>.\r\n\r\nTaking two holes to complete, Morgan was finally able to take a deep sigh of relief as she put away the tournament.",

    "articleText": "Amateurs posted nice showings this year, but  defending champ Bob Sowards once again held them off at the 35th annual Ohio Senior Open.\r\n\r\nThe former PGA Tour and Nationwide Tour member led the 36-hole tournament played at Firestone Country Club wire-to-wire, posting two rounds of 2-under 68 to win by four. \r\n\r\nAnd while the numbers on the leaderboard make Sowards' victory look easy, but conditions were anything but.\r\n\r\n“It was hard out there all day,” Sowards told the Northern Ohio PGA.  “The wind was blowing in all four directions and it kept changing. That made it tough when it came to picking clubs. I thought I played well on the front. I just didn’t hit it close enough to have many birdie chances. But that changed on the back.”\r\n\r\nOne of our AmateurGolf.com members who played with him -- Tony Hejna of Cleveland, took note.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n\"Bob won the event in the last nine holes, said Hejna, a young senior at 52.  \"He Just kept everything in front of him, hit solid shots in the wind, and made a couple of putts.  The 32 he shot coming in was very strong.”\r\n\r\nAlong with Sowards' high level of skill in all aspects of the game, there's just something intangible about PGA Tour experience.\r\n\r\n“Bob’s resume speaks for itself,” continued Hejna. “It’s great to play with guys who have competed at that level and continue to do so. \r\n\r\nHejna - who finished T3 at the 2019 New York State Am and qualified for the 2017 and 2018 U.S. Mid-Ams -- was a part of a group of amateurs that gave it a run but could not quite get over the hump. Finishing the tournament at one-over, Hejna was bested by Seville, Ohio’s Howard Clendenin who shot an even-par 140 to take solo second and finish the tournament as the low amateur.\r\n\r\nFirestone West put up a solid fight in the breezy conditions as it allowed just 10 sub-70 rounds in a field of over 100 golfers.\r\n\r\n“Firestone is a great place,” Hejna said. “I have been fortunate enough to play all three courses here over the past few years. The West course is probably the most forgiving which was perfect for an event like this but the windy conditions required you to golf the ball well.”",

But while Shepherd fell just short, she was able to find something in her game that paid off in the state am.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“It was nice to have that one-day IWGA event at Anderson Country Club,” said Shepherd to the IWGA. “I took some things away from that event and got really solid with the two days I had. I’ve hit it better the first couple days here than I have in a long time.”",

    "teaser": "The former LSU star Humphries tied the course record of 67 to win his second straight title at Bayou Oaks in New Orleans",
    "articleText": "John Humphries waited 16 years before winning his second Louisiana Amateur in 2019. (<a href = \"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25250/Former-LSU-star-Humphries-gets-another-Louisiana-Am-title\">read story></a>) \r\n\r\nThe wait wasn't as long for win number three, this year's 101st playing of the historic championship.\r\n\r\nToday at New Orleans' Bayou Oaks at City Park, Humphries (of Woodworth, Louisiana) tied the course record of 5-under 67. That got him to 9-under on the tournament, allowing the former LSU start to pass the three members of the final group playing behind him, and escape with a one stroke victory over Eli Ortego of Broussard, who was playing with him.\r\n\r\nAnother shot back tied for third at 7-under were third round leader (and fellow Mid-Am) Derek Busby of Ruston (final round 73) and Grayson Gilbert of Monroe (final round 70)\r\n\r\nAt one point on the back nine, six players shared the lead. That was a fitting finish to a tournament in which a different player held the lead after each of the four rounds. In the end, it was Humphries' course-record tying play that pushed him over the top.\r\n\r\nHe parred the first four holes then made back-to-back birdies on Hole Nos. 5 and 6.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAfter making the turn at two-under par 34. Humphries got hot again back-to-back birdies at the par 5 11th and the par 4 12th. \r\n\r\nHumphries made his lone bogey of the day on No. 15, but bounced back with a birdie one hole later. He closed things out with a birdie on No. 18, pushing him a shot in front of Ortego, who played solid down the stretch with four-straight pars after a birdie on No. 14. Ortego is a senior at Ascension Episcopal High School who, no doubt has a fine career in front of him.\r\n\r\nBut the 101st Louisiana State Am was another for the Mid-Ams, putting Humphries back on top as the top-ranked player in the state.\r\n\r\nNine competitors finished under par for the championship:\r\n\r\nRounding out the top-5 Nicholas Arcement of Thibodaux and Greg Berthelot of Baton Rouge. Berthelot finished the third round with the only eagle on No. 18, setting him up for a final group pairing a shot out of the lead. After hanging around with the leaders through 12 holes, he struggle with two bogeys and a double coming home but still posted a very solid tournament total of 5-under thanks to three-straight under par rounds.\r\n\r\n<b>TOURNAMENT NOTES </b>(courtesy Louisiana Golf Association)\r\n\r\nHumphries became the fifth player all-time, and first since 1968, to win at least three Louisiana Amateur Championships, and he is also the first player to ever win this championship in three different decades. He previously won when he was 23 (84th Louisiana Amateur at Southern Trace Country Club in 2003) and 39 years of age (100th Louisiana Amateur last year at Baton Rouge Country Club). \r\n\r\nThis was the first time that the South Course at Bayou Oaks at City Park, which opened in 2017, hosted the Louisiana Amateur Championship and it did not disappoint. The course was in excellent condition and drew rave reviews from this field of the top amateur players in Louisiana. It’s especially fitting that the 101st edition of this championship was held on the property of the City Park Golf Complex that originally opened in 1902. The course played to a par of 72 at approximately 7,000 yards on Sunday.",

    "teaser": "Bryan Hoops wins the men's title for the second time in three years, while Mari Miezwa claims the women's crown by 9-shots",
    "articleText": "Bryan Hoops of Chandler posted a final round of 3-under 67 to win the 54-hole Arizona Mid-Amateur by four shots over Abe Candelaria, Mitchell Holmes, and Kristoffer Marshall. \r\n\r\nThe tournament was played at the beautiful Talking Stick Golf Club in Scottsdale.\r\n\r\nIt was the second title in three years in this tournament for Hoops, who at age 51 is playing golf like a man half his age. \r\n\r\nMaybe better.\r\n\r\nHoops (pronounced \"hops\") posted rounds of 67, 68, and 69 this year, after losing in a playoff to Michaell Martin last year and winning the title in 2018.\r\n\r\nFor his part, Martin did a nice job of coming back from an opening round 74 by posting rounds of 69 and 67 on Saturday and Sunday. But it was the last few holes of his first 18 holes that did the defending champ in -- he was going along nicely, but made bogey on No. 15 before finishing triple bogey, bogey on the last two holes. \r\n\r\nHoops had other competitors to contend with though.\r\n\r\nHe entered the final round tied with Mike Wagner at 5-under 135. When Hoops bogeyed the first hole Sunday, Wagner took a 1-shot lead but it was ever so brief. Hoops came back with an eagle on the par-5 second, and while he did bogey No. 3, Wagner did as well.\r\n\r\n\"I had a mud-ball on No. 1, and it cost me a bogey,\" said Hoops. \"No big deal. I came back and hit a huge drive on the next hole, and only had 8-iron and I hit it to 12-feet and made it.\"\r\n\r\nHoops, who says 51 is just a number, hit that drive on the second hole (which measures 580) a full 368 yards.\r\n\r\nFrom there, Hoops never looked back, making three birdies and not a single bogey from Hole Nos. 4 through 18. With Wagner dropping back with two bogeys and a double to shoot 74, it was up to the other players to make a charge.\r\n\r\nBrett Howard, the third member of the final pairing, was hitting it close for the first nine holes, but not dropping any putts. After a three-putt on No. 9, he went for some shots he tried to press for birdies and that strategy wound up costing him as a final round 78 dropped him to 24th.\r\n\r\n\"I never had a three putt this week,\" said Hoops. \"I've been playing at Whisper Rock during the last few weeks with Ken Tanigawa (the fomer standout am turned Champions tour pro), Paul Casey, and John Rahm -- good stuff just gets absorbed.,\" said Hoops.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nBoth Abe Candelaria and Mitchell Holmes shot 66 to take their best shot, but they were too far back heading into the final round to catch Hoops. Both finished T2 with Kristoffer Marshall, who posted a final round 68. All three finished four shots back at 4-under, while Chris Kamin rounded out the top-5, posting 68 to finish 3-under for the tournament.\r\n\r\n<b>WOMEN'S DIVISION</b>\r\n\r\nMari Miezwa of Arizona Golf Club posted a 54-hole total of 8-over to win the tournament by 9 shots over Kim Eaton of Apache Wells.\r\n\r\nBut get this.\r\n\r\nEaton started the tournament with a 16-over 86 and didn't give up, despite having two snowmen on the scorecard in round one. She moved from 9th place in the 12 player field to solo second by posting rounds of 71 and 70 in the last two rounds.\r\n\r\nThose rounds were the second and third lowest in the tournament. The only player who scored lower in any round was the champion, who posted 69 on Saturday. \r\n\r\n",

    "articleText": "<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/25131/Michael-Salazar?p=1\">Michael Salazar</a> of El Paso shot a final round 5-under 65 to win the New Mexico - West Texas Amateur at Horizon Golf Club in Horizon City, Texas.\r\n\r\nSalazar, whose senior season at Grand Canyon University was cut short by the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, started the day three shots behind overnight leader <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/23326/Ryo-Harada?p=1\">Ryo Harada</a> of Japan and Las Cruces, N.M. Harada, whose rounds of 70-68 gave him a two-shot lead, never could get anything going in the final round, dropping four shots before finally picking up his first birdie at the final hole for a 73 and a tied fourth place finish.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nSalazar didn't immediately take advantage however, starting slowly with two bogeys in the first four holes. But he righted the ship with three birdies by the turn to go out in even par, and then caught fire on the back nine, coming home in 30 with three birdies and a hole-out eagle at the par-4 11th. He closed his round with two straight birdies for a three shot win at 4 under par.\r\n\r\nHorizon City is on the eastern edge of El Paso, and the Eastwood High School graduate Salazar was playing home game this week. Another local product, Javier Delgadillo, closed with a 66 to climb into a second-place tie with Aidan Thomas of Bernalillo, N.M. and New Mexico State University.\r\n\r\nSalazar is no stranger to low numbers. Two summers ago, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/21526/62-is-the-Ultimate-Slump-Buster-for-Salazar-at-TX-State-Open\">he shot a final-round 62</a> to finish fifth in the Texas State Open and earn low amateur honors. He won his first college event this past season at the Mark Simpson Invitational hosted by the University of Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe New Mexico - West Texas Amateur is essentially the state championship of New Mexico, but with cities like El Paso so far away from any of the larger population centers of Texas where its state championships are played, players from there are eligible to compete in the event.",

    "articleText": "The coronavirus pandemic has rearranged the 2020 competitive golf schedule. Professional majors have been rescheduled or cancelled, the college season was cut short, and the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/TheMajorsOfAmateurGolf\">Majors of Amateur Golf</a> calendar thinned out.\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26004/List-of-amateur-tournaments-affected-by-the-coronavirus-outbreak\">List of amateur tournaments affected by the coronavirus outbreak</a>\r\n\r\nIn our <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26055/The-return-of-the-state-am-\">original article</a>, we took a look at how state amateur championships, once considered among the most important tournaments to win, have struggled to draw top amateurs to their fields, as such players increasingly favor traveling out of state to play against each other. Some of the numbers were striking.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAs the year progresses, we are keeping an eye on state amateur championships around the country, looking to see if they might be the unexpected beneficiaries of the coronavirus pandemic, if players indeed travel less and stay closer to home.\r\n\r\n<b>August 2 update</b>\r\n\r\nThis was the biggest week of the summer for state amateurs, with 10 states -- Iowa, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Arizona and California -- conducting their state championships (New York was also scheduled but cancelled due to COVID-19).\r\n\r\nBut running opposite the Western Amateur meant that top-ranked players across the board skipped their state championships, even in the case of a defending champion like <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24757/William-Mouw?p=1\">William Mouw</a>, who skipped a title defense in California to compete in the Western (in fairness to California, they were originally scheduled to host the state am earlier in the summer but had to postpone due to COVID-19).\r\n\r\n<b>July 19 update</b>\r\n\r\nThis week there were a few players that chose the Southern Amateur over their state am, but overall the states continued to see improved fields in 2020.\r\n\r\nIn Ohio, six of the top eight ranked players were in the field as Austin Greaser moved to No. 1 with an eight-shot win at Columbus Country Club.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts, seven of the top ten players competed for the state amateur title.\r\n\r\n<b>July 12 update</b>\r\n\r\nIn Georgia, only two of the state's top ten players were in the field, with the highest-ranked player, Luke Schniederjans, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26186/Luke-Schniederjans-wins-99th-Georgia-Amateur\">taking the title</a>. Many of the other highly-ranked players chose to pay in the North & South and/or the Southern Amateur.\r\n\r\nMany of the smaller states continue to draw their best players as in normal years. In Maine, No. 1 ranked Cole Anderson successfully defended his title, while Garren Poirier (Vermont) and James Pleat (New Hampshire) rose to No. 1 with their wins.\r\n\r\n<b>June 28 update</b>\r\n\r\nSix state amateurs teed off this past week, and all six had great fields. In Mississippi, where a <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26150/Isaiah-Jackson-wins-The-Mississippi-Amateur\">PGA Tour start was on the line</a>, eight of the top ten players in the state were in the field. Oregon, Arkansas and Missouri all had seven top-10 players playing, while Missouri had six. And four of the top five players from the state of Wyoming competed in their state championship.\r\n\r\n<b>June 21 update</b>\r\n\r\nThe North Carolina Amateur only drew one player in the state's top 10 (#4 Jonathan Brightwell who lost in a playoff to Peter Fountain), and 6 in the top 20. Many of the state's top-raked players, including #1 Ryan Gerard of Raleigh, will be in the field at next week's North & South Amateur in Pinehurst.\r\n\r\n<b>June 14 update</b>\r\n\r\nThe Louisiana State Amateur was the first men's state am to tee off post-lockdown, with <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26119/Louisiana-Amateur--John-Humphries-wins-his-second-straight-\">John Humphries winning his second-straight title</a>. An impressive five of the top seven ranked players in the state of Louisiana were in the field, including the eventual champion, but the top two -- LSU Tiger teammates Philip Barbaree and Trey Winstead -- skipped the event.\r\n\r\nIn Indiana, two USGA champions battled for the women's state championship, with Erica Shepherd pulling away from Julia Potter-Bobb <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26117/Shepherd-wins-battle-of-USGA-champs-at-Indiana-Women-s-Am\">to win her first Indiana state title</a>.\r\n\r\nAlso, Paul Pope of the Ohio Golf Association reports that they have received a record number of qualifier and exempt player entries into the Ohio Amateur, which will be held in mid-July.",

    "articleText": "The PGA Tour was not the only group playing competitive golf this weekend. With the PGA Tour back, amateur golf continued its momentum as the industry bounces back from quarantine.\r\n\r\nAuburn junior Wells Padgett and his partner Tracy Chamberlin were nearly unstoppable in their Kansas Four-Ball Championship win at Eagle Bend Golf Course in Lawrence, Kan. With an opening-round 63, the duo was rolling early.\r\n\r\n“I think we’re really good for a four-ball because he’s just very solid, he makes a bunch of pars,” Padgett said regarding Chamberlin. “I’m the one that can get the putter going and make a bunch of birdies.”\r\n\r\nChamberlin, an accomplished senior amateur and repeat Kansas Golf Association Senior Series Champion, approached Padgett to play in the event as the two have played a lot of golf together over the years and Padgett was looking for an event to fill his summer schedule.\r\n\r\nPadgett shot a bogey-free seven-under on his own ball to Chamberlin’s 3-under first round. With Chamberlin carding a birdie on two holes that Padgett did not, the team made quick work to get to the top of the leaderboard. Tied with Josh Williams and Kit Grove for second place, Padgett and Chamberlin sat one off the lead behind Zach Sokolosky and Grant Herrenbruck.\r\n\r\nWith nearly no wind on the plains over the weekend, Padgett and Chamberlin took advantage of the slightly slow greens and low-90’s temperatures to best their first round.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nWith Chamberlin’s consistent play, Padgett was allowed to play aggressively as he carded a 10-under 62 to help the duo secure a four-stroke win.\r\n\r\n“It’s really nice to have a guy you know is going to be in the fairway and never be in trouble off the tee,” Padgett said.\r\n\r\nShooting lights out under the gun of tournament play has done wonders for the Auburn Tiger. \r\n\r\n“It was just really good to get into tournament play and just test my game out. Tournament juice is different than playing against your friends every day so it was nice to see my practice and work pay off under tournament pressure,” Padgett said.\r\n\r\nWorking with Scott Hamilton in Georgia while at Auburn and Bill Glasson in Oklahoma while at home in Witchita, Kan., Padgett has been grinding to get his game to the next level as he approaches his senior year with the Tigers.\r\n\r\nPadgett is heading out to the Sizzler in Scottsdale next week before heading back home to compete in the Kansas Am and the Southern Am at Maridoe before heading back to Alabama for school.",

Then the next hole, butchered again, made bogey. So at that point, it was let's just grind something out and finish strong.\"\r\n\r\nFinish strong he did. Following the three straight bogeys on Hole Nos. 13, 14, and 15, Redding closed the championship out with three straight pars to seal the victory with a final round 74, clearing the field by four shots.\r\n\r\nAndrew Passanante and Chad Skarperud finished the tournament both finished with a 222 with Passanante taking the second-place purse.",

I kind of knew that I had the lead, but I was playing as if somebody behind me was playing great.”\r\n\r\nAlthough playing as if someone was behind him, Bunten was in the final group and kept the mentality of being chased to lap the field. Coming down the stretch, Bunten slipped slightly with a bogey on No. 15 but immediately got the shot back with a birdie on No. 16 before slamming the door shut with a birdie on No. 18 to close out the championship.\r\n\r\nEast Carolina dotted the top of the leaderboard as Bunten’s teammate Patrick Stephenson finished in solo second with a 3-under 213 total.

    "teaser": "In an effort to create a field similar to one with qualifiers, a combination of WAGR position and other criteria will be used",
    "articleText": "Four weeks ago, we learned that the only USGA events to be held in 2020 would be the Men's and Women's U.S. Amateurs and U.S. Opens. We also learned that the fields for the amateur events would be determined largely by the World Amateur Golf Rankings. But we didn't know how many players would be in each tournament's field, or how exactly they would go about building the fields.<br><br>\r\n\r\nToday the USGA announced the exemption categories for both historic championships, which will be played for the 120th time in August.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"Our overall goal is to conduct great championships,\" said USGA president Stuart Francis in a <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26071/A-candid-conversation-with-USGA-president-Stuart-Francis\">Zoom call after the announcement was made</a> to trim down the USGA schedule. \"We just didn't feel we could do that in terms of doing qualifying and conducting another eight or ten championships more this year.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nExemption categories for both the U.S. Women’s Amateur and U.S. Amateur are highlighted by expanded use of the World Amateur Golf Ranking and Women’s World Amateur Golf Ranking as well as finishes in recent USGA championships, plus past champions of Entries open Friday, June 26 and close Wednesday, July 8 at 5 p.m. EDT.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"If WAGR was not in the positions it is now, we probably couldn't have made this step,\" added Francis, addressing the continued improvement in the World Amateur Golf Ranking's ability to accurately identify top players.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Women’s Amateur Championship is set to take place Aug. 3-9 at Woodmont Country Club, in Rockville, Maryland, followed by the U.S. Amateur, which will be held Aug. 10-16 at Bandon Dunes Golf Resort, in Bandon, Oregon.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nIn order to align with health and safety guidelines, the USGA also announced a reduction in field size for both championships. The U.S. Women’s Amateur, typically played with 156 golfers, will be limited to a field size of 132. The U.S. Amateur, traditionally held with 312 competitors, will be played with 264. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe top 225 men as of June 24 in the WAGR ranking will be exempt into the U.S. Amateur while the top-75 women are \"automatics\" for the Women's Am. The cutoff date for rankings selections is June 24. <br><br>\r\n\r\nTo ensure age that the typical age diversity of a qualifier-based field is preserved, the top 20-ranked women under the age of 19 will gain exemptions while the top 25 men over the age of 25 will gain entry.<br><br>\r\n\r\nExemptions will be provided to top finishers in recent USGA events, plus male and female winners of major amateur events like the British Amateur, Latin American Amateur, and Asia Pacific Am (men) and the Mexican International and European Amateurs (women). <br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/championships/2020/u-s--amateur/articles/2020-u-s--amateur-exemptions.html\" target=\"_blank\">Full Men's U.S. Amateur Exemption List</a> <br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/championships/2020/u-s--women-s-amateur/articles/2020-u-s--women-s-amateur-exemptions.html\" target=\"_blank\">Full Women's U.S. Amateur Exemption List</a> <br><br>\r\n\r\nOnce the field is set, the USGA will compile an alternate list for each championship based on WAGR. All non-exempt players who wish to be considered for the remaining spots or alternate status must complete a preliminary application at champs.usga.org prior to the close of entries on July 8. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIn addition, the USGA shared that entries for the 2021 U.S. Women’s Amateur Four-Ball Championship (April 24-28 at Maridoe Golf Club in Carrollton, Texas) and 2021 U.S. Amateur Four-Ball Championship (May 22-26 at Chambers Bay in University Place, Wash.) will open the week of Aug. 17.

Twice.\r\n\r\nThe former University of Colorado Colorado Springs PING First-Team All-American became just the fifth player in state history to win both the Colorado Amateur and the Colorado Match Play championships. Prater also became just the third mid-amateur to win the event since 2000.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nTraditionally dominated by collegiates, Prater dominated the event from wire to wire. Qualifying as the No. 1 seed after shooting a 4-under 68 during Monday’s seeding round, Prater won his Round of 64 match 7&5, his Round of 32 match 2&1, his Round of 16 match 3&1, his quarterfinal match 4&3, and his semifinal match 2 up, earning his way to face University of Colorado senior Ross Macdonald in the 36-hole championship match.\r\n\r\nMacdonald found himself in the championship match for the second time in three years. Sitting 1 down to Prater through 12 holes, Macdonald fell apart with three bogeys by the time the pair got to the 17th tee. Prater continued to draw blood with a 12-foot dagger for birdie on No. 18 to give himself a 5 up cushion as the duo made their way to the final 18.\r\n\r\nWith help from Macdonald as well as his own great play, Prater extended his lead from 1 up on the 13th tee to 7 up on the 21st tee.\r\n\r\nMacdonald squandered away a 12-under performance on the week as he went 8-over on the final 17 holes of the match en route to an 8&7 loss.\r\n\r\n“I was just trying to play catch-up,” Macdonald told the Colorado Golf Association. “Colin didn’t make any mistakes, so it was tough to catch him because his short game was on and he wasn’t hitting it too bad. He definitely deserved that win. He was steady. He was hitting fairways and hitting greens. When he missed a green, he had some great chips and was rolling the putter. I didn’t see him have a three-putt all day.”\r\n\r\nPrater, a science teacher and girls high school golf coach by day is well aware of his rare feats.\r\n\r\n“No matter what it is, it’s cool to win it. I’m super honored and super lucky to have been able to play forever. It’s kind of goofy that I never won this event when I was still playing in college. I had to wait until I got out of college and had a real full-time job in order to actually win it…This one I might cherish it a little bit more because I did it at 25.”",

    "articleText": "A third year tournament at Modesto's Del Rio Country Club didn't just increase their field by being one of the only June competitions during the pandemic.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThey tripled it.<br><br>\r\n\r\nPlayers who competed in either of the first two Billy Bell Cups know how amazing the namesake's design at Del Rio Country Club is. It's a private, 27-hole facility with gorgeous tree-lined fairways, challenging players off the tee, and everywhere else with healthy rough and fast and firm targets.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe first two years were played with Mid-Am and Senior Divisions; this year the committee added an open flight and the further increased interest. Winning by a single shot was the St. Mary's College team of Blake Hathcoat of Fresno and Mikey Slesinski of La Quinta. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00060704.jpg\"><br>Blake Hathcoat and Mikey Slesinski</div></div>In Thursday's first round, the pair had everything going, both posting the equivalent of 67 (with the usual concessions after a partner is in the hole) and a best-ball of 8-under 64. Slesinski lit it up early, recording five birdies on the first six holes. And when his putter cooled down, Hathcoat tossed in three birdies of his own.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOn such a challenging course, you would think that would leave teams behind them giving chase. But top Northern California Mid-Ams Nick Moore (Monterey) and Matt Cohn (San Francisco) were able to post the same, setting up a battle of the Mids and young guns in the final round.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOn Friday, there were plenty of times when Hathcoat and Slesinski could have let things get away, as neither player shot lower than 74. But sometimes it's all about the ham and egg, and they were able to do plenty of that.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"Both of us were able to buckle down and come through when the other wasn’t having a great hole,\" said Slesinski in an AmateurGolf.com interview. \"We both knew going into the tournament that the nine holes on the Bluff were more suited for scoring low so we made it our goal to play those holes well.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nSlesinski went on to call the river nine -- being used for the first time this year at the Billy Bell Cup -- more difficult.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"A combination of hard visualization and tough pins made that nine harder to score on,\" he said. We really had to focus on where the best leave was after our approach shots because as the greens got firmer, leaving it above the hole was a no-go. <br><br>\r\n\r\nDespite both players posting rounds of 74 and 75 on their own, they only took one team bogey, and that consistency gave them the edge over Moore and Cohn (11-under 133) , and the Turlock team of Paul Smith and Teddy Schrier who matched the low final round of 66 to tie second.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n<B>SENIOR & SUPER SENIOR DIVISIONS</B><br><br>\r\n\r\nAs close as the open division was, the senior was even closer. Randy Haag and Joey Ferrari posted 7-under for 36 holes to tie the always formidable team of Jeff Wilson and Todd Barsotti - two former University of The Pacific teammates.  <br><br>\r\n\r\nHaag and Ferrari claimed the title on the second playoff hole.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Super Senior division was not as close, Jeff Burda and Ron Johnson shot out to a nice day big lead and won by four strokes over Charles Ricesin (Lodi) and Scott Anderson (Bakersfield).<br><br>\r\n\r\nJim Knoll, who almost all the senior golfers in Northern California rely on for his weekly golf reports, had nothing but praise for the superintendent and tournament and pro-shop staffs:<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"The course was in fantastic shape,\" reported Knoll in his email update. \"And after living in seclusion for the last couple of months, it was great to see everyone again and to be able to compete.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nIndeed. In just three short years, The Billy Bell Cup has arrived.",

Qualifying on Monday with an even-par round of 70, Barbin was the three-seed in the 32-man match play bracket.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nMaking easy work of his first two matches 2 up and 6 up, Barbin squared up against Penn State’s Lukas Clark. Holding a 1 up lead on Clark for six of the first 10 holes, Barbin went on to win holes 11 and 12 to go 3 up, retaining the lead through the 16th hole to advance to the semifinals 3 & 2.\r\n\r\nBarbin’s semifinal match was against 1996 Philadelphia Open champion, Brian Gillespie. Despite playing solid golf, Gillespie won just two holes as Barbin led wire-to-wire in a 4 & 3 win.\r\n\r\nIn the 36-hole championship match, Barbin faced St. Joseph University senior Michael O’Brien. The duo traded holes back and forth for much of the first 18 holes which saw Barbin take a 1 up advantage as they headed to the 19th hole.\r\n\r\nBarbin turned on the afterburners as he won holes 20-22 to go 4 up and saw his lead swell to 6 up as they took the turn following hole No. 27. Battling back, O’Brien simply ran out of holes as he cut Barbin’s lead down to 4 up before Barbin birdied the par 4 15th (hole 33) to win the match and championship 5 & 3.\r\n\r\nNot a bad run considering it was only the second time in five tries that Barbin has made match play in this event.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been in the mix here and there. I haven’t really won anything this big in my career,” said Barbin to the GAP. “To be able to break the ice and win something like this is just an honor. Especially being one of the oldest tournaments in golf. There are no words to describe how I’m feeling. I worked really hard on my game so the fact I’ve put myself in this position and the fact I got it done and my game held up under pressure. I’m proud of myself.”",

That's four wins in four different decades.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe 2013 Walker Cup team member has had a storied amateur career including wins at the Azalea Amateur in 2015 and the Palmetto Amateur in 2010 as well as numerous USGA championship appearances including a win in the inaugural U.S. Four-Ball Championship in 2015.\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/14475/Nathan-Smith--Todd-White-win-7-and-5-for-inaugural-U-S--Amateur-Four-Ball-title\">Nathan Smith, Todd White win 7-and-5 for inaugural U.S. Amateur Four-Ball title</a>\r\n\r\nWhite, 52, settled back into his well-worn saddle at the SC Amateur Match Play this week. Qualifying as the 27-seed, White went 4 & 3, 5 & 4, 3 & 1, 2 & 1 on his way to the ever-familiar championship match.\r\n\r\nPlaying against College of Charleston senior Logan Sowell, nearly 30 years his junior, White rattled off four birdies on the first five holes giving him a 3 up advantage early. Building on his lead as he has built on his amateur golf career, White nailed the final three nails in the coffin on holes 10, 11, and 13 for a 6 & 5 win.\r\n\r\n“The college guys, they hit it so much further than we mid-ams and senior-ams, so we’ve got to be able to find some way to compete,” White told Carolinas Golf Association. “Orangeburg Country Club is not overly long, so it lends itself to me having the opportunity to compete.”\r\n\r\nSeparating himself from Barry Black and Bert Atkinson who hold three titles to their name, White now sits atop the match play mountain.\r\n\r\n“Being able to win in 1991, 2004, 2010 and now in 2020, I am most proud of the longevity with which I’ve been able to maintain my game,” White said. “That’s something to be proud of, and I’d be lying if I said that winning that fourth and separating myself from Bert and Barry was not a goal, because it has been a goal. Three years ago, I missed out on accomplishing it. Luckily I had the opportunity to do it today and was able to get it done.”",

That won't be allowed for this year’s edition of the Rice Planters. \r\n\r\nCollege coaches who have already lost out on the opportunity to recruit at major southern summer tournaments like the Dogwood Invitational -- which was canceled due to the pandemic --  will have an opportunity to make up for lost time, albeit an abbreviated version of the normal tournament.\r\n\r\nThe Rice Planters has also been reduced by a round, taking the tournament from 72-holes down to 54-holes. \r\n\r\nCoronavirus has also slimmed the field down to just 30 spots this year. Qualifying was also trimmed down with just five spots set aside for qualifiers outside of those who were exempt based on their 2019 Rice Planters finish (plus committee selections).\r\n\r\n\"At the end of the day, it's the same 18 holes, the same pin locations, the same everything,\" Austin Fulton told AmateurGolf.com. \"Even with it being cut down, the field is going to be just as strong.\"\r\n\r\nFulton, a rising senior at Mississippi State leads the highlights the elite exempt list. He leads the talented field as he looks to defend his wire-to-wire 2019 title win during this year's unique circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"It (the Rice Planters) means a lot for me,\" Fulton said. \"It was my first amateur win...Literally, since I left here last year I've looked forward to coming back this year to play again.\"",

    "articleText": "Incoming Auburn freshman John Marshall Butler was on fire at the 2020 Sizzler.\r\n\r\nComing out of the gates strong, Butler opened up with an 8-under 64, good for the tournament-low and a two-shot lead heading into the second round. Following the stellar performance with a 67 on Tuesday, Butler held a three-shot lead over Oklahoma State freshman Hazen Newman heading into Wednesday’s final round.\r\n\r\nWith Newman falling to the wayside on the final day, Oregon State rising sophomore Jackson Lake gave Butler a run for his money. Trailing by six shots through 36-holes, Lake ran the table and jumped up the leaderboard on Wednesday with a bogey-free final round 66. With Butler posting a 69, Lake was not able to catch the record-setting pace set by Butler.\r\n\r\nWith a total of 200, Butler set the new tournament scoring record for the Sizzler, which is in its fourth year.\r\n\r\n“I think the key this week for me was keeping the ball in the fairway,” Butler told the Troon Saguaro Amateur Series. “If you miss fairways out here, you can shoot a high number.  I had a very good low cut shot off the tee this week which allowed me to hit driver down the middle.”\r\n\r\nEven as he sputtered down the stretch, Butler was still confident enough in his game to scrape together two birdies to negate a double-bogey he carded on No. 12.\r\n\r\n“My wedge game was solid and although I missed some putts, I gave myself a lot of opportunities,” said Butler. “I grinded it out on the last 9 holes when it seemed my swing had left me.”\r\n\r\nThis marks the second time in just under a month that Butler has won a fairly prestigious event against a stacked field. In May, Butler took home the crown at The Dye at Crooked Stick against a field of some of the nation’s elite juniors.\r\n\r\nPiggybacking off the win at Crooked Stick to pick up a win at Troon North, Butler says that the win will “upstart” his amateur career.",

Winning No. 17 with a par, the momentum swung back in Fosdick’s favor when he drilled a 25-foot birdie putt on No. 18 to cut Paladino’s lead to three.\r\n\r\n“It’s hard not to get down when you’re behind 5 holes after 16,” Fosdick told the Connecticut State Golf Association. “But you have to know that you still have twenty holes left. It’s not over till it’s over so you kind of hang in. The par on 17 in the morning and the 25-footer I made on 18, very aggressive, but that just gave me a lot of momentum heading into the second 18. I knew I needed to leave myself a little hope, and if I did that I could be aggressive with some putts and maybe roll some in. I had to go really low to win.”\r\n\r\nPaladino reciprocated the sentiment.\r\n\r\n“It’s match play, so you know you’re going to have the ups and downs,\" Paladino said. \"Chris was exceptional. It’s not like I started playing really poorly or anything like that.\"\r\n\r\nWinning holes 19, 21, and 27 on the day, Fosdick tied the match as the pair headed to the final nine holes. Beginning on No. 27, Fosdick won four of the next five holes, gaining a 3-up advantage.\r\n\r\nNot going down without a fight, Paladino won the 32nd hole and won the 34th hole with an eagle, buying himself a full 36 holes. Splitting pars on the closing two holes, Fosdick completed the comeback to win 1-up.\r\n\r\nFosdick nearly opted to play in the Monday qualifier for the PGA Tour's Travelers Championship which is being played just down the road. Sticking to his prior commitment to play in the State Amateur surely paid off.\r\n\r\n\"I think I made the right call,\" he quipped.",

    "articleText": "Golf and hockey have not meshed this well since Happy Gilmore learned how to putt.\r\n\r\nThe Michigan Amateur Championship crowned its 109th champion this week following eight rounds of fantastic golf at Boyne Highlands Resort.\r\n\r\nMichigan State rising senior James Piot and recent Spartan graduate Andrew Walker shared medalist honors at 6-under through 36-holes before the championship shifted gears to match play.\r\n\r\nThe duo split ways in the Round of 16 as Walker lost his match to rising Mercer University senior Tyler Copp. Piot and Copp battled their way to a championship match.\r\n\r\nCopp had quite the challenge ahead of him as Piot was arguably the hottest player in the event. After sharing medalist honors, Piot went 7 & 5, 7 & 6, 4 & 3, 1 up, and 4 & 3 on his way to his matchup against Copp.\r\n\r\nA former hockey goalie in his youth and brother of Winnipeg Jets center, Andrew, Copp was unfazed by Piot’s performance. Taking a 1 up lead on the opening hole, Copp used the mental toughness he learned at the rink. Piot countered with wins on the second and third hole before Copp regained control, building a 2 up lead through 10 holes.\r\n\r\n3 up through 12, Copp dropped a hole to Piot on 13. Needing an up-and-down on 14 to maintain his 2 up advantage, Copp zipped a 50-yard chip shot to less than a foot to keep the match in his favor.\r\n\r\n“That was huge up-and-down,” Copp told the Golf Association of Michigan. “I probably have had better ones, but that was the most important one I’ve ever had. It was the biggest shot of the day. James had momentum there.”\r\n\r\nCopp reflected on the tournament and just how much golf he played over the week saying that he \"thrives\" in match play more so than four days of stroke play.\r\n\r\n\"I like to get honed-in and not think about the what-ifs,\" Copp said. \"My mentality was good all week and I stayed mentally sharp and played well.”\r\n\r\nAnn Arbor has not been able to claim a Michigan Amateur champ since William Newcombe won the event in 1967.\r\n\r\n“It’s the most important golf tournament that I’ve wanted to win,\" said Copp. \"It makes me want to just keep on winning bigger and bigger tournaments.”",

    "teaser": "The Texas duo of Randall Conn and Johan Andersson improve their first round score by 6, take halfway lead",
    "articleText": "Texas teams have faired well at the Two Man Links Championship over its 19 year history. \r\n\r\n2020 is proving no different, as Randall Conn and Johan Andersson of Trophy Club are out to the 36-hole lead at 1-over 144 gross. \r\n\r\nIf those scores look high for a best-ball event consider the tournament's opening round, when sustained gusts of 35 mph at Pacific Dunes had most of the field holding on for dear life on Hole Nos. 10-13, which played straight into the north wind. And if you were able to get your ball onto the putting surface in regulation, standing up straight to hole putts posed another problem altogether.\r\n\r\nBut at least most of us were playing our own clubs -- Randall Conn's didn't arrive on time and he was forced to play with rentals in those conditions. He and Andersson did well to keep things close enough to par (4-over 75 best-ball) to allow their 69 today at Bandon Dunes to vault them into first place overall gross in the 21 team field.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the Conn/Andersson duo recorded just a single birdie. (Heck, pars felt like birdies on some holes that played into the wind, and Conn was playing with borrowed clubs.)\r\n\r\nBut Friday, the wind calmed down (at least on the front nine), the tee times were earlier, and it was warm enough for some brave souls to wear shorts. Conn and Andersson took full advantage, recording five birdies and never \"topping\" each other with birdies on the same hole. Bogeys on No. 5 and 17 (the latter playing with a tricky crosswind and front hole location) caused them to give back two of those red numbers, but they lead both the overall gross (by a single shot over two teams) and the senior division gross (by two shots over multiple past champions Sherman Haggerty and Ben Whipple).\r\n\r\nBryan Jeziorski and Kevin McSorley of New Jersey had the low gross round of the day today, a 5-under 67 at Bandon Dunes. The are tied second with David and Kevin Cannon at 2-over 145.\r\n\r\n<b>NET DIVISION</b>\r\n\r\nIf the gross 67 by Bryan Jeziorski and Kevin McSorley sounds good as the gross round of the day, how about their net 59? \r\n\r\nThat score, coming off an opening round of 1-over 72 at Pacific Dunes, puts them at 12-under net and in command by two shots over two father/son teams -- Randall and Jordan Schwartz (pictured) and Daniel and Sam Licursi. The Schwartz team hail from Northern California; the Licursi duo is from Thousand Oaks, in Southern California.\r\n\r\nThere is plenty of golf left - tomorrow's third round is at the resort's newest course, Sheep Ranch, which opened June 1. Course co-designer Ben Crenshaw is on property this week, by the way. He played behind us this afternoon on The 13 hole par-3 course Bandon Preserve, which he also designed (along with Bandon Trails -- this writer's favorite).\r\n\r\n<b>FATHER SON DIVISION</b>\r\n\r\nDave and Kevin Cannon (2-over 145) lead the gross father/son division by a single shot over Daniel and Sam Licursi.  Randall and Jordan Schwartz are tied for the net lead with the Licursi duo after an 11-under 61 today vaulted them up to 10-under net after 36-holes.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n<B>WE'RE PLAYING THE 19TH ANNUAL - BUT WE ALMOST DIDN'T</B>\r\n\r\nThe Two Man Links Championship tournament almost missed its 19th playing due to COVID-19. Originally scheduled for late April, we cancelled the event -- originally slated for 40 teams with half of them in the father/son division -- in it's entirety as the resort shut down from mid-April to mid-May.\r\n\r\nWhen a window of opportunity opened for June, many of the teams who play every year opted to go, and we had a tournament again. Many drove from the San Francisco Bay Area and as far as San Diego. But some decided to fly, and while most had no incidents many experienced travel delays and flight changes that made the journey here a circuitous (and time consuming) one. \r\n\r\nA shout out to the entire staff at Bandon Dunes and to all of the players who are here with us this week -- playing golf at Bandon Dunes is allowing us all to clear our heads for the week and spend some quality father/son and friendship time together.",

    "articleText": "Lansdon Robbins (UNC Wilmington/Davidson, N.C.) shot a searing 5-under 67 to win the men’s tournament in the inaugural Golfweek Myrtle Beach Collegiate Friday at Barefoot Resort’s Dye Course.\r\n\r\nTaylor Roberts (Parkland, Fla.), a rising freshman at Florida State, led wire-to-wire, finishing at 4-under par, two strokes clear of Marissa Wenzler (Kentucky), to win the women’s tournament.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe Golfweek Myrtle Beach Collegiate welcomed 119 players - 78 men, 41 women - to America’s most popular golf destination, providing them a chance to compete in a 54-hole tournament against their peers as the COVID-19 pandemic abruptly ended the college golf sPlayers from 51 colleges and universities played in the men’s event while 32 schools were represented in the women’s tournament.\r\n\r\nRobbins entered the final round tied with Chase Korte (Austin Peay State/Metropolis, Ill.) at 5-under, and the rising sophomore blistered the 7,152-yard Pete Dye design en route to a one-shot victory over Korte. Robbins finished the event at 10-under par.\r\n\r\nCarding birdies on No. 1 and No. 3, Robbins was en route to a 33 on the front. Korte, who bogeyed the third hole to fall three back, wasn’t deterred and he pulled even with Robbins after a birdie at 10. Korte continued to play well, making birdie on the 12 and 13th holes, but Robbins found another gear.\r\n\r\nBeginning at the par-4 11th, Robbins birdied four consecutive holes, seizing control of the event. Korte made birdie on No. 16 but it was sandwiched between a pair of bogeys, that allowed Robbins to take a three-stroke lead to 18th tee.\r\n\r\nRobbins made a double-bogey six on the final hole to narrow his margin of victory.   \r\n\r\nOn the women's side, Roberts entered the final round with a one-stroke lead and never wavered. After Nicole Adam (Pinehurst, N.C./North Carolina), who entered the day in second place, double-bogeyed the opening hole, Roberts never led by fewer than two shots the rest of the way.\r\n\r\nWenzler equaled the low round of the week on the women’s side with a final round 68, vaulting her from fifth place to second.\r\n\r\nThis was Roberts’ second victory in Myrtle Beach in 2020 as she won the Dustin Johnson World Junior Golf Championship in March.\r\n\r\nSeveral golfers with ties to Myrtle Beach competed in the event. Smith Knaffle (Murrells Inlet/South Carolina) finished at +6 after three consecutive rounds of 74, good for a ninth-place finish in the women’s tournament.\r\n\r\nOn the men’s side, Holden Grigg (Myrtle Beach), Connor Newton (Auburn, Ala.) and States Fort (Evans, Ga), all members of the Coastal Carolina University golf team, competed, as did Patrick Golden (Murrells Inlet/College of Charleston) and Keegan Vaughn (Myrtle Beach, S.C./Charleston Southern).\r\n\r\nFort was 4-under for the event, good for a fourth-place finish, while Golden, who was even for the week, finished tied for eighth.  Newton was 41st, Grigg finished 59th, and Vaughn was 61st.\r\n\r\nThe Golfweek Myrtle Beach Collegiate is the third significant amateur tournament played in Myrtle Beach this year, joining the Dustin Johnson World Junior Golf Championship (TPC Myrtle Beach) and the General Hackler Championship (Dunes Golf & Beach Club).\r\n\r\nBarefoot’s Dye Course was an ideal host venue, allowing some of the game’s best young players to challenge themselves on the Pete Dye classic. The layout has been ranked among America’s 100 Greatest Public Courses by Golf Digest and is the long time host of the Hootie & the Blowfish Monday After the Masters Celebrity Pro-Am.",

    "articleText": "University of Kansas’ Luke Kluver added a trophy to his shelf that he has wanted for a long time.\r\n\r\nThe Nebraska native and rising Jayhawk junior, home for the summer, had not won a Nebraska Golf Association title prior to this past week.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nEarning medalist honors after 36-holes of seeding, Kluver shot a 138 (6-under) for a one-shot ‘victory’ before the event flipped to match play.\r\n\r\nAs the one-seed, Kluver went 7 & 6, 4 & 3, 1 up (through 20), and 2 up on his way to the championship 36-hole match against 44-year old Ryan Nietfeldt. The matchup heavily favored Nietfeldt as he was going for a record 10th NGA title to become the oldest Nebraska match play winner since 2001.\r\n\r\n3-down through 18, Kluver began to make his charge.\r\n\r\n“Making 3 on the first hole just let him know I was here to play and I was going to come after him,’’ Kluver told the Omaha World Harold. “To be able to square the match after four holes was huge, and I was able to just keep applying pressure on him as the match went on.”\r\n\r\nTying the match and then taking a 1 up lead at the turn, Kluver never looked back. Winning holes No. 10, 11, 13, and 14, Kluver took control of the match on the back-nine for a 5 & 4 win and his first-ever NGA event.\r\n\r\n“This is definitely the biggest amateur golf event I’ve won,’’ he said. “It means a lot being in the state of Nebraska, and just feeling able to put my name on that trophy with a lot of other guys is a big-time success.”",

With the 111th Oregon Amateur, the Amateur Golf two-man links at Bandon Dunes, and the 45th Pacific Northwest Golf Association Men’s Master-40 Amateur.\r\n\r\nThe five-day event culminated with an 18-hole championship match between Tom Brandes of Bellevue, Washington, and Tacoma, Washington’s Dana Christianson.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nBrandes, the one-seed, earned medalist honors following the 36-hole qualifier. Working his way towards the championship match, Brandes went 7 & 6, 2 & 1, and 6 & 4 en route to facing off against Christianson.\r\n\r\nAll square at the turn, Brandes began to strike.\r\n\r\nWinning holes No. 9 and 10, Brandes took a 1 up lead before taking command of the match with wins on holes 12, 13, and 14 to take a 4 up lead with five to play. Christianson, needing a win on No. 15 to extend the match, failed to do so, giving Brandes the championship.\r\n\r\n“I want to give a shout-out to Dana,” Brandes told the PNGA. “A real gentleman. I’ve known him for many years, but we’ve never been paired together. He played really, really solid. I was kind of watching his game, and I thought I’d better bring my ‘A’ game.”\r\n\r\nThe event was Brandes’ first tournament back from the COVID-19 forced play stoppage, leaving him impressed with his game.\r\n\r\n“I had no expectations because I hadn’t played in anything since last fall,” Brandes said. “So, yeah, I hit it real well, and came out on top.”\r\n\r\nTwice a runner-up at the event, the 2015 PNGA Hall of Fame inductee and seven-time senior player of the year is relieved with the win, saying that “Match play is a different animal,” and that “It’s good to finally not be the runner-up.”",

    "articleText": "The 19th AmateurGolf.com Two Man Links Championship almost didn't happen. But it turned out to be one of the most fun events we've played at Bandon Dunes.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMaybe it was the pent up demand to play tournament golf, in what was the first travel event since the coronavirus pandemic for most of us.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut whatever the case, playing Bandon Dunes was here for us, and the 21 teams the competed at Pacific Dunes, Bandon Dunes, Sheep Ranch, and Bandon Trails ensured that the 20th annual event next year won't need to be marked with an asterisk. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe overall gross tournament turned into a battle between two senior teams, who found themselves paired together in the final group. One of them, Sherman Haggerty of El Dorado Hills, California has played 17 of the 19 events. He and partner Ben Whipple were one stroke behind the Trophy Club, Texas team of Randall Conn and Johan Andersson standing on the 17th tee at Bandon Trails. <br><br>\r\n\r\nNo. 17 is easy on the eye, but not very generous to anything but a well-struck and properly flighted golf shot. Andersson, who just weeks before the tournament stepped up as a last minute partner for Conn, did the same on No. 17, sticking his 7-iron and converting the putt for just the second birdie of the day on the hole.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith Haggerty and Whipple taking bogey, the lead was three and that's where it finished, as both Conn and Whipple made solid ten foot birdie putts on No. 18. \"COVID-bumps\" ensued, as the good spirited competition came to an end with Conn and Andersson posting 6-under 65 -- the lowest best-ball gross score on any of the courses this week. They didn't make a single team bogey. (And indeed Conn posted a bogey-free 67 on his own ball - likely beating Ben Crenshaw, who played the course he designed in front of our group.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFor the week, Conn and Andersson posted 4-under 282, while Haggerty and Whipple posted 1-under 285.

That kind of teamwork allowed them to keep moving in the right direction on the net side, especially in the second round at Bandon Dunes where they shot 11-under 61. Following those rounds with 65 and 63 added up to 25-under for the 72-hole event, good enough for a three shot victory over Bryan Jeziorski and Kevin McSorley of New Jersey. The Licursi duo, from Thousand Oaks, California finished third.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<B>GEORGE AND MICHAEL STEVENS FATHER & SON DIVISION</B><br><br>\r\n\r\nOne of our most loyal returning teams inspired us to add a new division to the Two Man Links Championship, and name the trophy in their honor. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe elder Stevens, son of legendary filmmaker George Stevens and a motion picture industry legend in his own right, was lured to Bandon Dunes by his son Michael to play the tournament in 2005. The team placed a very respectable fifth place that first year and were hooked. They found their stride several years later, picking up team titles in both 2008 (against our biggest net field ever of almost 20 teams) and 2010.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe duo last paired at Bandon in 2013, shortly after Michael was diagnosed with stomach cancer. He passed away in 2015.<br><br>\r\n\r\nLong time tournament players will no doubt remember the Stevens. They genuinely loved the resort. The Stevens really participated in the tournament and its surrounding events -- I can't remember them ever missing a tournament dinner. George, who is now 87 years old, was sure that Michael would be pleased with the trophy being named in their honor.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"We loved our time with you and the others at Bandon Dunes,\" said Stevens. \"It provided some of our richest father/son moments.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00060758.jpg\"><br>Daniel and Sam Licursi</div></div>Sam and Daniel Licursi won the inaugural gross title, on the strength of Sam's steady play and Daniel increasingly finding the explosiveness that helped him compete on the Nationwide tour a few years back.

Their weekly total of 3-over was very good for third overall, as noted above.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBehind them in second place was Dave and Kevin Cannon (Oakland and Santa Barbara) who played steady golf all week in posting 6-over for 72 holes.<br><br>\r\n\r\nRandall and Jordan Schwartz took the Father and Son Net title, in addition to the overall net.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>SKINS GAME</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nEveryone loves a good skins game, and the magic of Golf Genius and the wizardry of AmateurGolf.com's own Chris Brauner helped us keep track of things all week.

    "articleText": "The Mississippi State Amateur was highly contested and came down to the final nine holes.\r\n\r\nHolding a two-shot lead heading into Sunday, Memphis senior Isaiah Jackson stayed consistent en route to his first Mississippi State Amateur win.\r\n\r\n“I knew there were a lot of guys and a lot of talent behind me that could catch me,” Jackson told AmateurGolf.com. “I knew that there was a possibility that someone would go low and catch up to me.”\r\n\r\nJackson knew where he stood heading into the day but once on the course, he did not look at the leaderboard until the back nine.\r\n\r\n“When I got to the back nine I said ‘I might as well know’,” Jackson said. “Regardless of what it says I’m going to stick to my gameplan and just see what happens.”\r\n\r\nWith previous champs Joseph Deraney (2019) and Wilson Furr (2018) gaining ground, Jackson buckled down to maintain his lead. Playing consistently and not attacking pins when he did not need to, Jackson built upon his front nine 35, adding birdies on No. 11 and No. 17 for a closing 34, bookending his tournament with a pair of 69s. Tapping in for par on 18, Jackson secured a four-stroke victory.\r\n\r\n“I gave myself a lot of opportunities and made it really hard to make bogeys,” Jackson said. “I don’t know, I just put myself in good positions.”\r\n\r\nAttacking when he saw appropriate, going for par-5s in two when he could, and making putts all week, Jackson simply said his game was in a “good spot” all week. Going 72 holes without a three-putt or anything worse than a bogey, Jackson was impressed with himself since he has not played competitively since March.\r\n\r\nA senior this past season, Jackson cannot wait to take advantage of the NCAA allowing him another year of eligibility due to COVID-19.\r\n\r\n“We had a good enough team to win conference [this past season],” said Jackson. “I feel like with everybody coming back this year, we’ll be able to do something special.”\r\n\r\nWith the win, Jackson earned himself his first PGA Tour start at the Sanderson Farms Championship, which will be held Oct. 1-4 at the Country Club of Jackson.",

    "articleText": "Missouri crowned a new men’s amateur champion this past weekend.\r\n\r\nCentral Missouri redshirt sophomore Nick Westrich weaved his way through six days of golf to climb his way to the top of the proverbial Missouri golf mountain.\r\n\r\nQualifying as a 5-seed, Westrich felt good early in the tournament despite not having played much since the quarantine began.\r\n\r\n“I played a match with my friends the week before the Mo-Am,” Westrich told AmateurGolf.com. “My putter, we were just not getting along very well. I just grinded on my putting the last few days before the tournament.”\r\n\r\nHappy with his swing, Westrich found that the course suited his eye and his game to near perfection. Working on his putter prior to the tournament proved valuable as Westrich said that he made putts when needed to and rolled it well over the course of the week.\r\n\r\n“I shot a bogey-free 4-under and that was the best round of the day,” Westrich said. “That’s when I knew I could do something special that week.”\r\n\r\nSomething special was, in fact, brewing for Westrich. Advancing to the championship round via wins of 5 & 4, 2 & 1, 1 up (thru 19), 4 & 3, and 2 & 1, Westrich caught back up with a recently made friend, Missouri State signee, Maxwell Kreikemeier. Westrich and Kerikemeier met on Monday as they played the qualifying rounds together.\r\n\r\n“We played the first two rounds together in stroke play and we actually became pretty good friends spending that much time together,” said Westrich. “We were both pulling for each other to get that far.”\r\n\r\nThe championship match swung back and forth through the first 11 holes with neither pulling away. All square through 11, Westrich began to strike.\r\n\r\n“On the back nine I got a few up on him and stayed there,” Westrich said. “I felt comfortable and just kept pushing.”\r\n\r\nTaking a 3 up lead to the 19th hole, Westrich gave one back to start the final 18. Kreikemeier kept sticking with Westrich but could not keep up for long as Westrich took a 4 up lead on No. 30, clinching the championship on hole 32 for a 5 & 4 victory.\r\n\r\nAlthough the win is great, Westrich is already looking forward to the upcoming collegiate season.\r\n\r\n“We were the No. 2 ranked team in Division II and the No. 18 ranked team overall [last season]”, Westrich said. “We kind of have a chip on our shoulder next year to prove something.”",

Kicking off the mad dash to Bandon Dunes is the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/1757/North-and-South-Men-s-Amateur-Championship\">North & South Amateur</a> at Pinehurst, beginning Tuesday with a champion being crowned on July 4.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nNext, Maridoe Golf Club will once again be at the center of amateur golf as they play host to the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/1869/Southern-Amateur-Championship\">Southern Amateur</a> (July 15-18). Maridoe previously hosted two COVID-19 relief tournaments and the Maridoe Junior as golf \"reopened\".<br><br>\r\n\r\nForced to move from its original date, the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/1011/Sunnehanna-Amateur-Tournament-for-Champions\">Sunnehanna Amateur</a> tees off in Pennsylvania on July 21-24. Wrapping up the PGA Tour-like schedule is the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/1307/Western-Amateur-Championship\">Western Amateur</a> hosted by Crooked Stick Golf Club July 28-August 1.<br><br>\r\n\r\nEach of the four tournaments is expecting their deepest field ever as amateur majors across the world have been cancelled due to the pandemic. And with the USGA cancelling U.S. Amateur qualifying, these events offer the chance for players to play their way into the championship.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I don't think there's any question it only enhances the reputation of these events,\" said Sunnehanna co-chairman John Yerger. \"I think within the golf community, these tournaments are very well known, but to those on the periphery, I think it's an eye-opener.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe USGA will be exempting the winners and runners-up of the four majors into the 2020 U.S. Amateur field.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>The Road to Bandon Dunes:</b><br>\r\n<hr>\r\n<ul class=\"contentList\">\r\n<li><img src=\"/images/uploads/00033716.jpg\" alt=\"Pinehurst Resort and Country Club - Course 2\"><div class=\"newsLatestTeaser\"><a href=\"/amateur-golf-tournaments/1757/North-and-South-Men-s-Amateur-Championship\">North & South Men's Amateur Championship</a><br/>Pinehurst Resort and Country Club - Course 2<br/>Pinehurst, NC<br/>Jun 30, 2020 - Jul 04, 2020</div></li>\r\n<li><img src=\"/images/uploads/00031005.jpg\" alt=\"Maridoe Golf Club\"><div class=\"newsLatestTeaser\"><a href=\"/amateur-golf-tournaments/1869/Southern-Amateur-Championship\">Southern Amateur Championship</a><br/>Maridoe Golf Club<br/>Carrollton, TX<br/>Jul 15, 2020 - Jul 18, 2020</div></li>\r\n<li><img src=\"/images/uploads/00008006.jpg\" alt=\"Sunnehanna Country Club\"><div class=\"newsLatestTeaser\"><a href=\"/amateur-golf-tournaments/1011/Sunnehanna-Amateur-Tournament-for-Champions\">Sunnehanna Amateur Tournament for Champions</a><br/>Sunnehanna Country Club<br/>Johnstown, PA<br/>Jul 21, 2020 - Jul 24, 2020</div></li>\r\n<li><img src=\"/images/uploads/00006061.jpg\" alt=\"Crooked Stick Golf Club\"><div class=\"newsLatestTeaser\"><a href=\"/amateur-golf-tournaments/1307/Western-Amateur-Championship\">Western Amateur Championship</a><br/>Crooked Stick Golf Club<br/>Carmel, IN<br/>Jul 28, 2020 - Aug 01, 2020</div></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<hr><br>\r\n\r\nSince the Sunnehanna and Southern Amateur are stroke-play events, there will be no limit on exemptions for T-2 finishes. If three players tie for second, all will qualify for Bandon Dunes. The North & South and Western Amateur are match play, so only two players from each will receive the exemptions.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMany top players will already be exempt, including the top 225 in the World Amateur Golf Ranking (WAGR) and all match play qualifiers from last year's U.S. Amateur. But for everyone else, this is their chance to get in.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"This [move by the USGA] was done for those who may not be exempt,\" Yerger said. \"I think it puts the onus on our tournaments to, not necessarily provide opportunities to guys that may be exempt, but to guys that may just be outside of the present number.<br><br>\r\n\r\nLast year, both <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21300/A-J--Ott?p=1\">A.J. Ott</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/17698/Noah-Woolsey?p=1\">Noah Woolsey</a> were outside the top 225 when they arrived at Chenal Country Club for the Southern Amateur. Ott went on to beat Woolsey <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25241/Ott-climbs--then-wins-playoff-for-Southern-Amateur-title\">in a playoff.</a> Since neither was exempt for the U.S. Amateur, both had to enter qualifying. Ott made it, Woolsey didn't. Had it happened this year, both would have been exempt into the championship.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"Every player that we try to invite from here on in, those invitations are enhanced because we understand the implications for some guys,\" said Yerger. \"It's really important for them in terms of this year.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nYerger went on to say that \"every opportunity matters\" in terms of who benefits the most from the USGA's decision.",

En route to besting the course record by a stroke which was set by Brandon Wu and Karl Vilips at the 2019 U.S. Amateur, Sharpstene carded three straight birdies on Nos. 14-16.\r\n\r\n“Everything was connecting today,” Sharpstene told Pinehurst, “as you can tell.”\r\n\r\nGrowing up in nearby Asheville, North Carolina, Sharpstene had a history with No. 4 before the Gil Hanse redesign in 2018.\r\n\r\n“I love Pinehurst,” he said. “I played U.S. Kids growing up and made one of the biggest putts of my life as a kid here. It’s just a golfer’s paradise. I love it here.”\r\n\r\nTuesday’s round was not much to write home about until Sharpstene reached the par-5 9th. 1-under to that point, Sharpstene rattled off back-to-back birdies before giving a shot back at the par-3 11th but picked it back up with a birdie on No. 12. Keeping everything in front of him, Sharpstene went on a hot streak down the stretch with birdies on 14, 15, and 16.\r\n\r\n“I was playing really steady, and then made a 30-footer on 14,” he said. “That made me think, ‘Ok, now I got it going.’ Then I hit to 5 feet on 15 and drove the 16th and two-putted.”\r\n\r\nAlthough the lowest round of the day, Sharpstene has plenty of company just behind him on the leaderboard.\r\n\r\nTexas sophomore Travis Vick tied the previous course record with a 5-under effort. Scorching hot North Carolina signee Peter Fountain and defending North & South champ Cooper Dossey (Texas) leads a pack of five golfers who sit just two strokes behind Sharptene’s lead.\r\n\r\nSharpstene and Vick switch over to Pinehurst No. 2 while Dossey and Fountain head to No. 4 for the second and final round of stroke play on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nThe top 32 finishers from stroke play will advance to match play. The North & South Amateur was recently granted special exemption status by the USGA, sending the champion and runner-up to the U.S. Amateur in August.",

    "articleText": "The USGA announced the exemption categories for the 2020 U.S. Women’s Open on Wednesday.<br><br> \r\n\r\nThe event, which was pushed back to December 10-13 due to COVID-19, will be hosted by Champions Golf Club in Houston, Texas. While adapting to a fluid situation, the USGA is doing their best to still keep the core of its four remaining championships the same.<br> <br> \r\n\r\n“We are extremely pleased to still provide the world’s best professional and amateur players the opportunity to compete for this historic championship, despite forgoing qualifying,” USGA senior managing director of championships John Bodenhamer said via a press release. “After carefully examining previous years, these exemption categories allow us to closely mirror a traditional field, and we are excited to witness one of these players win what will truly be a milestone 75th U.S. Women’s Open.”<br> <br> \r\n\r\nOn average, the U.S. Women’s Open has roughly 25 amateur players in its field. How the USGA is navigating the exemptions for amateurs is fairly straightforward.<br> <br> \r\n\r\nThe World Amateur Golf Ranking will be used to determine the amateur competitors. The top 20 WAGR point leaders as of Nov. 4 will be selected, unless already otherwise exempt into the U.S. Women’s Open.<br> <br> \r\n\r\nThe U.S. Women’s Open has a rich history of amateurs playing well in the event. In 1967, Catherine Lacoste won the U.S. Open as an amateur. Brittany Lang and Morgan Pressel both finished runner-up to Birdie Kim at the 2005 U.S. Women’s Open. Just last year, Duke stand out Gina Kim finished T-12 at the Country Club of Charleston.<br> <br> \r\n\r\nGiving amateurs a clean-cut path to an exemption is just another reason why the USGA is knocking COVID-19 out of the park.<br> <br> \r\n\r\n<B>ABOUT CHAMPIONS GOLF CLUB</B><BR><BR>\r\n\r\nChampions Golf Club was founded by Jack Burke, Jr. and the late Jimmy Demaret in 1957. From its origin, Champions has consistently carved its place in golf history hosting such prestigious events as the Ryder Cup Matches in 1967, the United States Open in 1969 and the PGA Tour Championship (five times, most recently in 2003).<BR><BR>\r\n\r\nThe Cypress Creek course is worthy of the championships it has hosted. The course is best known for its massive greens, which offer a myriad of hole locations, and require precise iron play to create realistic chances for birdie. The 7th green alone is over 70 yards deep!<BR><BR>\r\n\r\nChampions epitomizes the \"tough but fair\" design philosophy that ruled at the time it was designed--there are no pushover holes, every shot is well-defended, and a good score must be earned. The course is not without its thrilling shots, however, as evidenced at the par-3 4th (where Ben Hogan famously made a 9 during his last competition on the PGA Tour), the all-carry 8th and 12th, and the bite-off-as-much-as-you-dare tee shots on the par-5 9th and 13th.<BR><BR>\r\n\r\nThe club has an impressive number of low handicaps, and strong sense of its place in the history of Texas golf. The clubhouse setting is ideal for tournament golf, with the huge putting green, practice tee, 1st and 10th tees and 9th and 18th greens all within view from the clubhouse. To top it all off, Champions also has one of the best locker rooms in all of golf.\r\n",

The 64-year-old topped a field for the seventh time over his illustrious career at Southern Nevada Amateur Championship.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I don’t like to think of myself as being that much older, obviously I certainly am,” Exber told AmateurGolf.com. “I do get a kick out of the young guys when they talk amongst themselves and they say ‘Is that guy really that good?’”<br><br>\r\n\r\nExber carded a bogey-less 4-under 68 on the first day of the 36-hole event and sat atop the leaderboard as one of just four rounds that were at or under par. Turning around for day two, mother nature was not wanting to corporate for those in the field.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith winds gusting over 40-miles-per-hour, Exber had a narrow one-stoke lead over former Nevada State Amateur champion, Daren Johnson.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“There was one par-3 on the second day that was playing 150-yards, but I hit a 5 iron,” Exber said.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAble to keep damage to a minimum by keeping his ball in play, Exber posted a birdie-less 75, securing the championship by four strokes.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“For some reason, I have received so many text messages that say congratulations. I’m sure it has something to do with my age.” Exber said through a chuckle.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHis win this past weekend is not an anomaly. Exber is an expert when it comes to the game of golf as he competes in senior and non-senior amateur events across the country. In 2018 alone, Exber took home three crowns on the national level including an international win at the Canadian Senior Open. Although the accolades are great, Exber is extremely grateful for those he’s built relationships with.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I’m very appreciative of the guys at Country Club of Charleston with the Azalea,” said Exber. “They understand it is a game for life and they give guys a chance to play.”\r\n",

    "articleText": "Former Washington Huskie Alice Duan outlasted her opponents to take home the Washington Women’s Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\nFollowing an opening round of 75, Duan had to knock away some rust before taking command of the tournament.\r\n\r\n“Honestly, I was just pretty rusty the first nine holes,” Duan told AmateurGolf.com “I sort of forgot we were playing a tournament, to be honest, I was just enjoying being out in the trees and playing with my freshman Brittany [Kwon]. I was actually 5 over thru 12 holes and managed to turn it around after that. Henry, my caddy, and I got into a good rhythm and worked well together.”\r\n\r\nIn a tie for third after day one, Duan got back to her competitive instincts as it was her first tournament since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out. Combating her first-round 75 with a 69 on Wednesday, Duan was back to even and just one shot behind Washington State signee Madelyn Gamble.\r\n\r\nHeading into the final round, Duan’s expectations heading into the week allowed her to stay steady and calm as herself and Gamble came down the stretch.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t set a goal or anything,” Duan said. “When I play golf now, I’m just interested in having a good time.\r\n\r\n“I felt some nerves just having not been at it for a while. I didn’t actually check the leaderboard at all this week. I just knew I needed to post a semi-low round and hope it would do. I didn’t know where anyone was at or what their score was relative to mine. I’m just interested in doing the best I can each shot.”\r\n\r\nDuan is looking forward to carrying the momentum from this win all the way to Lincoln, Nebraska as she is set to transfer to Nebraska come the fall semester.",

It did include an eagle on the par-4 7th hole -- where he drove it to 3 feet on the reachable par four -- and four birdies (three of them on the back nine.) <br><br>\r\n\r\nMaybe it was meant to be the whole week. <br><br>\r\n\r\nMaking the turn to No. 1 in Thursday's first round after a 10th tee start, Lewis rattled off six-straight birdies on Hole Nos. 10-15 on his way to an 8-under 64 (tied for the lead). And get this - it could have been seven-straight but not for a three putt by Lewis on No. 7, where he drove the green on the short par four. <br><br>\r\n\r\nLewis added a 70 on Friday to enter the final day one behind Scott, who fired the low round of the tournament Friday, a 9-under 63.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith 36-hole leaders <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/13845/Stan-Gann--Jr-?p=1\">Stan Gann, Jr.</a> (final round 73) and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21461/Mason-Williams?p=1\">Mason Williams</a> (final round 72) having trouble continuing the torrid pace that got them to 12-under, the lead was flopping around in the breeze, with Scott grabbing it with a birdie on No. 16 and keeping it with a par on No. 17.<br><br>\r\n\r\nLewis, who played two groups in front of the leaders, could only watch from the clubhouse as the outcome was now out of his hands. He had a clear view of the final group coming in, and he thought the tournament was Scott's as he watched him over his pitching wedge approach to No. 18, after a lengthy drive to the middle of the fairway. <br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I thought it was over when I saw where he drove it,\" Lewis said in a phone interview. \"But then his approach flew the green leaving him a tough up-and-down for the win.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen Scott's pitch shot went 12 feet by and he failed to convert, the pair headed back out to No. 1 for a playoff. Scott drove it 20 yards past Lewis, giving him the first go at the pin and he didn't disappoint, stiffing his approach to 3-feet. Scott misjudged the distance and wound up with a longer birdie attempt from the front of the green, and when he didn't convert it was Lewis' chance to claim his first amateur/collegiate victory.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I've won a lot of junior and regional events in Tennessee,\" said Lewis. \"But to get a win like this against collegiate and amateur players is a first.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nShortly after holing the three footer for the win, Lewis got a congratulatory call from his Tennessee coach Brennan Webb.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I have the best coach in the country,\" he said. \"He really cares about all 15 players on the team.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nLewis will enter his sophomore year at Tennessee, while Scott is going to start playing at Georgia this year as a transfer junior (from the College of Coastal Georgia). <br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00060875.jpg\"><br>Scott Ferrell</div></div><B>TOURNAMENT NOTES</B><br><br>\r\n\r\nHole in one -- Brunswick CC member Scott Ferrell made a hole in one on No. 17 today.

Seven golfers were within three shots of the leaders, making for an interesting Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nMetzger fell away early as he posted a 37/35 split for a 2-over Sunday. As the final group came down the stretch, the stage was primed for Lemieux and Phillips.\r\n\r\nPhillips lipped out a 3-foot par putt on the par-3 17th, giving Lemieux a one-stroke lead heading in the 54th and final hole.\r\n\r\nWith the duo pacing off similar 20-foot birdie putts, Phillips lagged his put to gimmie-range and knocked his in for par. Knowing where he stood, Lemieux did not bat an eye. Perfectly paced, the putt fell, giving Lemieux a two-stroke victory and his second win at the Westwood Invitational (2017).\r\n\r\nNot resting on his laurels, Lemieux is getting right back at it on Monday as he’s playing an Oklahoma State Amateur qualifier before heading to Hattiesburg, Mississippi as he’s a part of the field at the Magnolia. Returning a favor for his friend and rising Oklahoma junior Logan McAllister as he’ll be on the bag for McAllister at the Southern Amateur at Maridoe.",

    "articleText": "COVID-19 has had a wide-ranging effect on amateur golf, rearranging the calendar, forcing tournaments to incorporate new safety protocols, and causing golfers to rethink their travel schedules.\r\n\r\nFor Ben James (Milford, Ct.), a chance to play in a major of amateur golf had unintended consequences upon returning home, resulting in losing a chance to defend his state junior title he won last year.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nJames won the Connecticut State Junior at Watertown Golf Club last summer, which accompanied wins at the New England Junior, the Northern Junior and the AJGA Killington Championship. With high finishes at the Connecticut Open (a tie for third) and the Connecticut Amateur (quarterfinals), his resume was strong enough to earn an invitation into the prestigious North & South Amateur at Pinehurst No. 2.\r\n\r\nThe 17-year-old James shot rounds of 77-74 to miss out on match play, but he would fully realize the cost of his trip to Pinehurst upon his return home.\r\n\r\nOn June 25, just five days before the first round of the North & South, the state of Connecticut announced a travel advisory that, ahead of July 4 weekend, requires people arriving from states with high coronavirus rates to quarantine for 14 days. North Carolina was put on that list.\r\n\r\nFor James, that meant that upon his return home, he would have to quarantine for two weeks. With the Connecticut Junior starting on July 6, there was no way for him to play, and he was forced to withdraw from the event.\r\n\r\nFor the tournament, this means that the 25-year streak of no repeat winners will extend another year. For James, it's a couple weeks of rest and relaxation, and then surely back to the course to chase his next title.",

    "articleText": "In his second event back since the COVID-19 pandemic, Granite Bay, California native Dylan McDermott came away with a win at the 2020 Memorial Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\nMcDermott’s putter began the 54-hole event relatively warm and progressively got hotter and hotter as the week went on.\r\n\r\n“My putting was some of the best it’s ever been,” McDermott told AmateurGolf.com “When I started making putts, I started really thinking about going and trying to win it.”\r\n\r\nWith quarantine hindering the golf season, McDermott has been lucky enough to keep his game sharp at his home course. As places around California were shutting down to stop the curve, McDermott found solace at Granite Bay Golf Club.\r\n\r\nAs he tuned his swing and game for when tournament play resumed, one thing that could not be practiced was dealing with nerves. Following rounds of 66 and 68, McDermott held a two-shot lead at 10-under-par. With 18 holes left, McDermott began to feel the pressure.\r\n\r\n“For the first-nine, it definitely did [feel like match play],” McDermott said. “After that first-nine, Evan [Peterson] kind of fell off a bit.”\r\n\r\nAfter seeing David Laskin making a late charge, McDermott kept his head in the game just enough to post a final-round 72 to clear the charging Laskin by two strokes and the rest of the field by at least three.\r\n\r\nAs the summer begins to die down, the summer season is just heating up for McDermott. He heads out to his future home course in Boulder, Colorado for a tournament next week before heading out to Ohio for an AJGA event. Following that, McDermott will head back home to play in the California Amateur.\r\n\r\nThe class of 2021 golfer is verbally committed to play at the University of Colorado.",

Since 2018, the men’s champion receives exemptions into The Masters as well as The Open. The event is also one of four amateur championships acknowledged by WAGR as ‘elite’, joining the U.S. Amateur, British Amateur, and European Amateur.\r\n\r\nThe women’s championship began in 2018 with immediate success. Women champions earn exemptions into the AIG British Open, the Evian Championship, as well as an invite to the Augusta National Women’s Amateur.\r\n\r\nWith the cancellations, men’s defending champ, USC’s Lin Yuxin will have to wait another year to go for his third APAC championship. 2019 women’s champ Yuka Yasuda recently turned pro, forfeiting her ability to defend her title.",

The first to do so was Oklahoma State’s Hunter Mahan in 2003. Splitting the Hogan Award with Arizona’s Ricky Barnes, Mahan secured both the Haskins and Nicklaus to himself.\r\n\r\n2004 and 2005 saw dominance once again as UNLV’s Ryan Moore took home the triple crown in 2004 and Wake Forest’s Bill Haas doing the same in 2005. The sweep would not happen for nine years when Stanford’s Patrick Rodgers claimed top prestige in 2014.\r\n\r\nWith five players to grab all three awards in the same season, two others have nabbed all three throughout their collegiate careers. UCLA’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/8580/Patrick-Cantlay?p=1\">Patrick Cantlay</a> received Haskins and Nicklaus honors in 2011 and completed the career-sweep with the Hogan in 2012.

Missing the cut, Theegala will have opportunities with sponsor exemptions at the 3M Open Championship and the Barracuda Championship.\r\n\r\nDelta State’s Zach Zediker, Rob Wuethrich of Illinois Wesleyan, Dalton State’s Ben Rebne, and Jon Hopkins of Mississippi Gulf Coast join Theegala as winners of the Jack Nicklaus Award for their respective divisions (D-II through NJCAA).",

Carding back-to-back rounds of +13 in the Stableford event, Greer and Narramore overcame the team of Marcus Jones and Norton Rainey who fizzled out on the final day following a hot start.\r\n\r\n\"We kept telling ourselves all week that if we were going to win, we needed an eagle,\" Greer told AmateurGolf.com \"That was kind of the turning point of the match.\" \r\n\r\nGreer and Narramore put up a Wednesday best 15 points which included a 5-point eagle tallied by Narramore on the eighth hole.

Jones and Rainey did, however, hold onto a second-place finish, closing out with a +33 total.\r\n\r\nIn the senior division Chip Lutz and David Nelson put on a clinic over the 54-hole event as they bookended a +18 second round with a pair of +8 scores. Their second round was not only good for the low round of the tournament in the senior division but good for the lowest round of the tournament by two points.

I was extremely nervous,” Low told the Northern California Golf Association. “I just needed to settle down.”\r\n\r\nSettling in, Low went on to birdie her fourth hole (No. 12) and made the turn to the championship nine at 2-over on the day, maintaining her two-stroke lead she brought into the day over equally struggling Duke redshirt junior Miranda Wang.\r\n\r\nWang, an accomplished player in her own right, was playing the best golf of her career before COVID-19 cut her season short. Wang finished tied for second at the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge and three top-20s. In prior years, Wang saw starts on the LPGA Tour, making six of 10 cuts since 2017.  \r\n\r\nUnable to make up ground on Low, Wang carded a bogey on No. 12 and a double-bogey on No. 13 before closing her first nine with a birdie on No. 18 to go out in 38, matching Low.\r\n\r\n“Coming in down the stretch, I was just trying to avoid any mistakes,” Low said. \r\n\r\nDoing just that, Low kicked off the final nine holes with back-to-back birdies. Giving them right back on the following two holes, Low maintained her composure and rallied with two more birdies over the final four holes for a finishing 34. Wang also gained composure down the stretch but was unable to get to red numbers as she posted eight pars and a lone bogey to finish five-shots behind Low in solo second place.\r\n\r\n“I’m very relieved and proud to have won,” said Low, a rising high school junior. “I’ve been working hard on my game. It’s nice to see results.”\r\n\r\nLow has seen plenty of results over the past 12 months as she's racked up two wins and six top-10 finishes on the AJGA since July of last year.",

    "teaser": "In winning his 30th VSGA championship, Keith Decker teams with Roger Newsom to set the all-time scoring record",
    "articleText": "<i>By Chris Lang of the VSGA</i>\r\n\r\nBy the time Roger Newsom set up for his approach shot on No. 18 Wednesday afternoon at The Golden Horseshoe Golf Club’s Gold Course, the outcome of the 38th Virginia State Golf Association Senior Four-Ball Championship had already been decided. Newsom and partner Keith Decker teed off on the final hole with a four-shot lead, and considering they hadn’t made a bogey in the championship’s previous 35 holes, it would have taken something incredibly fluky to deny them the title.\r\n\r\nUndeterred, Newsom hit a hybrid from the fairway from about 155 yards out and holed out for eagle, putting a giant exclamation point on the most dominating performance in championship history.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nVirginia Beach’s Newsom (Elizabeth Manor G&CC) and Martinsville’s Decker (Ballyhack GC) broke the championship scoring record by three strokes with their two-day aggregate 19-under-par 123, shattering the previous mark of 126 set by Bob Morris and Pat Tallent in 2011.\r\n\r\nDecker won his record 30th VSGA championship; he won his fourth Four-Ball title, tying Tallent for third all-time in most victories in the event; and the Decker-Newsom side’s six-stroke win was the third largest margin of victory in the history of the championship.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the victory was not unexpected, considering the pedigree of the two competitors. Both are multi-time State Open of Virginia champions, and Newsom was a finalist at last year’s U.S. Senior Amateur, a run that secured him an exemption into this summer’s U.S. Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been looking forward to playing a two-man with Keith for a long time,” Newsom said. “I just thoroughly enjoyed. It’s just the fact that every time I got up on the tee, I never had to worry about being out of the hole. I knew Keith was going to grind … I mean, he can crush granite with his eyelids. He’s just going to grind, and he’s never going to let you down. It’s fun to play golf that way.”\r\n\r\nSaid Decker: “We’re both fighters. We like to win. And we’re not going to give up on each other. It all worked this week.”\r\n\r\nDecker and Newsom posted two bogey-free rounds and made at least birdie on each of the Gold Course’s par 5s over the tournament’s two days. They were in control from start to finish, though they managed a key up and down for par on No. 14 Wednesday to keep any hard-charging challengers at bay.\r\n\r\nAfter his tee shot on the par-4 hole veered off the right and settled on pine straw near a tree trunk, he escaped with a shot that hit the front of the green but trickled backward into a bunker. He got out of the sand and left himself with about eight feet for par, and he drained the putt to keep the side’s bogey-free tournament intact.\r\n\r\n“That was probably the biggest shot all day,” Newsom said.\r\n\r\nNewsom birdied the next hole to move the side to 17 under for the tournament, ending the chance for any real drama down the stretch.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“Then we sort of find out where we stood,” Decker said. “We knew we had it if we didn’t have a heart attack or break a leg or something. We were in good shape, and then he slammed the door on 18.”\r\n\r\nDecker and Newsom’s 7-under-par 64 was not the best score of the day Wednesday, but the four-stroke lead they opened the day with proved to be enough cushion to hold off the three sides that finished tied for second.\r\n\r\nFor the second straight year, Yorktown’s Bob Bailey (James River CC) and Midlothian’s Robert Nussey Jr. (Brandermill CC) followed up an unremarkable first round with a stellar second, posting a 10-under-par 61. They shot 59 in the final round last year at Wintergreen to clip Decker and Matt Sughrue by a stroke for the title, and Bailey even wore a Wintergreen hat to try to help recapture some of that magic.\r\n\r\n“We’re so far behind, that we’re able to play free and easy,” Bailey said. “You know you have to go out and scorch it to even end up in the top five.”\r\n\r\nGainesville’s Rich Buckner (Robert Trent Jones GC) and Haymarket’s Ron Clatterbuck (Evergreen CC) shot the round of the day, an 11-under-par 60 that moved them into the tie for second. But a first-round 69 left them too far behind to start the day to realistically compete for the championship.\r\n\r\n“We ham-and-egged it,” said Clatterbuck, who paired with Buckner last year to win the Golden Horseshoe Four-Ball. “We made the putts today. Yesterday, we didn’t get it going.”\r\n\r\nVirginia Beach’s Michael Hays (Princess Anne CC) and Chesapeake’s Scott Huneycutt (Riverfront GC) also tied for second, following a first-round 63 with a second-round 66 for a two-day 129. Five sides tied for fifth at 12-under 130.",

Jeff Frazier did just that at the 13th annual Brewer Cup.\r\n\r\nThe 55-year-old from Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania played in not only his first Golf Association of Pennsylvania event but also made his senior debut. \r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAfter qualifying with an even-par 72 on Monday, Frazier secured the 3-seed and immediately got to work. Kicking things off with a 6 & 5 win, Frazier turned around Tuesday afternoon with a 4 & 3 win to make quick work of his opponents as he advanced to the Final Four.\r\n\r\nOnce again, Frazier did not need all 18 holes as he advanced to the championship match 3 & 1. Saving his biggest challenge for last, Frazier was much like Sonny Frazier as he felt out his opponent Paul Rogowicz in the title ‘fight’.\r\n\r\nTied through four, it was Rogowicz that punched first on No. 5. With an immediate counter, Frazier tied the match back up on No. 6, taking a 1 up lead through the turn. Maintaining the lead through 14, the skies opened up adding drama to the final stretch.\r\n\r\n“It really started raining,” Frazier told the GAP. “And then Paul hit an incredible putt from deep, and I just missed on mine from 15 feet or so that I thought looked good.”\r\n\r\n1 up through 15, Frazier was able to keep Rogowicz at arm’s length to come away with a rain-soaked win.\r\n\r\n“Yeah, [sitting] feels good,” said Frazier, a seven-time U.S. Mid-Amateur competitor. “It’s been fun playing with these guys [at 55 years old]. It’s been a good week for me.”",

    "articleText": "A drought finally came to an end at the 101st Westchester Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\nBradford Tilley, a University of Virginia alumni, had not won the event since his college days in 2005. Playing against current collegiate golfers, Tilley definitely felt all of his 37-years this week.\r\n\r\n\"I worked out this offseason, so I guess that helped, but I am the old man,\" Tilley told The Journal News. \"I last won this when some of the kids playing this week were probably in diapers.\"\r\n\r\nQualifying for the match-play event on Monday with a 1-under 70, Tilley finished in a tie for third and was slotted as the 4-seed as the tournament switched over to match-play. Making quick work on his way to the finals, Tilley went 6 & 5, 4 & 3, before grinding his way to a 2 & 1 victory over rising Columbia junior, Nathan Han.\r\n\r\nSquaring off against Binghampton soon-to-be senior Justin Lane, Tilley took a minute to get into a groove. The 18-hole championship match began relatively slow as both golfers were 2-over through the first three holes, giving Lane a false sense of security.\r\n\r\n\"I was 1-up after three holes and was thinking, ‘OK, this is good,” Lane said.  I had never met Brad until this, but I heard that he was good.”\r\n\r\nBut then Tilley went on a roll. Winning hole Nos. 4, 5, and 9, Tilley took a 3 up lead to the turn. Continuing to further his lead with wins on holes 12, 13, and 14, Tilley put away Lane 6 & 4 to regain his crown he once won nearly half his life ago.\r\n\r\nAlthough a 15-year span between wins at the Westchester, Tilley is no stranger to winning as he took home the New York State Golf Association, Metropolitan Golf Association, and Westchester Golf Association Mid-Amateur championships within a span of 10 days last fall.",

    "articleText": "The temperature is not the only thing that is hot right now in Indiana.\r\n\r\nNoah Gillard won the Indiana Amateur just over two weeks ago and doubled down, striking while the iron was hot at the IGA Match Play.\r\n\r\n“Right now I’m just playing fundamental golf,” Gillard told AmateurGolf.com. “It’s worked really well for me this summer.”\r\n\r\nGillard used fundamentals to a ‘T’ as he marched towards the championship match. Never seeing the course before, Gillard had a rough front nine to open qualifying at Purdue’s Ackerman-Allen Course. 2-over (+2) through nine holes, Gillard flipped the switch on the backside to make the cut with a 5-under 31, good for third place and the 4-seed.\r\n\r\nCruising past the first round 6 & 4, Gillard’s toughest match of the week was against mid-am Jeremy Sims.\r\n\r\n“He just applied pressure the whole time, I mean he didn’t do anything silly, I had to earn all the holes that I won, it wasn’t given to me,” Gillard said. “I would definitely say he was my most stressful match.”\r\n\r\nGrinding out a 3 down deficit over the last six holes, Gillard was able to squeeze by Sims on the 19th hole.\r\n\r\nWinning his next two matches 2 up and 3 & 2, Gillard faced another mid-am in Brooks Snyder.\r\n\r\nAfter a par, birdie start, Gillard found himself 3 up through four quick holes. Maintaining his lead, Gillard carried the 3 up advantage to the final nine holes.\r\n\r\n“What really got my momentum going was on hole 11,” Gillard said. “I had a 9-footer for par to tie the hole and I made it. I think that really gave me a lot of confidence in myself because it was a tough up-and-down from where I was.”\r\n\r\nUsing the momentum from that par putt, Gillard capitalized by winning the next two holes (12 and 13) before ending the match on the 15th green to win 4 & 3.\r\n\r\n“I’ve made one bogey in that last three, four rounds,” said Gillard. “I’m just playing solid golf. I’m not short siding myself and giving myself good opportunities to get up-and-down when I do mis-hit it.”\r\n\r\nWith the fall quickly approaching, Gillard will be teeing it up at the Indiana Open next week before returning to Champaign, Illinois to (hopefully) join his Fighting Illini teammates.",

I haven't really thought about the score,\" Surratt told the Aiken Standard. \"I know that my good golf can compete with anybody, so if I keep that in mind and just commit to every single shot, one at a time, and don't think about my score then I should be good.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing an opening 63 with a 4-under 66 on Thursday, Surratt sits at 11-under with 36 holes left to play. However, with last week’s North & South champion Tyler Strafaci 5-shots behind Surratt, the 16-year old Indian Trail, North Carolina native has to keep the throttle down.\r\n\r\nSetting the pace should not be a problem for Surratt as he’s birdied 17 of the 54-holes he’s played this week a Palmetto Golf Club. 11 of those birdies have come over the past two days more than canceling out his lone bogey of the tournament which he carded on the par-3 11th on Thursday. Surratt, albeit a Monday qualifier, know he is up to par with the rest of the field.\r\n\r\n\"I realized when I got into the tournament, even though these guys are all exempt and everything, I belong here as much as they do,\" he said. \"I did my work to get in. I've just been trying to take the field out of play and just play my golf. I think it can compete with anybody as long as I'm sticking to it.\"\r\n\r\nOf the 51 players in red numbers yesterday, 21 remained under par. Louisville senior and Ireland native, Devin Morley was the biggest mover on Thursday as he carded the low round of the day (65) to jump 37 spots into a tie 17th at 1-under.\r\n\r\nPlay resumes at 7:30 am local time (EST) with Surratt, Strafaci, and Kentucky’s Alex Goff teeing off at 11:30 am.",

He shot 64.\r\n\r\nSeven-under-par on any course is pretty stout, but on Old Macdonald? The Tom Doak/Jim Urbina-designed, CB Macdonald-inspired course is widely acknowledged as the perfect layout for a match-play duel, but a tough place on which to keep a medal score going.\r\n\r\nShooting 64 there takes some different-level ball-striking – touch, finesse, scrambling, putting, patience, and course management – and it was these skills Humphrey had hoped would take him far in this year’s U.S. Amateur, which will be played at Bandon Dunes on August 10-16.\r\n\r\nBut with the <a href=\"There are now only 4 USGA championships left in 2020\" target=\"_blank\">USGA’s announcement</a> that all qualifying for the Amateur would be canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and that only exempt players would play in the championship, the dreams of Humphrey, and of 20 or so other of the resort’s caddies, went poof.\r\n\r\n>> Read the rest of Tony Dear's excellent article <a href=\"https://thepnga.org/flipping-the-script/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>",

    "articleText": "When women's college golf returns, look out for Bentley Cotton on her home course.\r\n\r\nIncoming University of Texas freshman (and Austin native) battled her way to a win at the 99th Women’s Texas Amateur over a natural rival in Texas A&M’s rising sophomore Makenzie Niblett. The competition was held at none other then the University of Texas Golf Club -- whose double entendre tagline is \"where champions play.\" \r\n\r\nQualifying with a one-over 72, Cotton was slated as the 6-seed. Getting through the first day's two matches with a 1-up and a 2 & 1 win, Cotton got past another Austinite, Stanford signee Sadie Englemann in a comeback 1 up victory as Cotton won four of the last five holes to advance to Thursday afternoon’s semifinals.\r\n\r\nIn the semis, Cotton had her biggest margin of victory with a 3 & 2 win over SMU senior Kennedy Pedigo.\r\n\r\nWasting no time, Cotton birdied the second hole of the 18-hole championship match against Niblett to take a 1 up lead. Carrying the lead all the way to the par-3 eighth where Niblett earned her first win of the day, Cotton countered immediately to regain a 1 up advantage as the duo made the turn.\r\n\r\nLosing her lead on the 10th, Cotton quickly regrouped with wins on the 11th and 12th holes for a 2 up lead through 12. Volleying between 2 up and 1 up, Cotton held Niblett’s comeback attempts at bay long enough to clinch the championship on the final hole as the pair split the hole with pars.\r\n\r\n“We went back and forth a lot today,” Cotton told the Texas Golf Association. “I was a little nervous on 18, but I just wanted to make par. I kept breathing and told myself, ‘You can do it.’”\r\n\r\nThe event was one of the more stacked events in the country this week as the field saw five of the top-100 ranked players in the World Amateur Golf Ranking.\r\n\r\n“It means a lot to me,” Cotton said. “It gives me a lot of confidence going into my next two events, which are the North and South Amateur and the U.S. Women’s Amateur. Especially with the same format, this gives me a lot of confidence.”",

It wouldn't have really mattered, because I would've hit the same golf shot. I just wanted a consistent turf that I could hit off of.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nTaking free relief, Strafaci fired a dart right at the pin leaving him a 10-foot birdie chance. Cleaning up for par, he claimed his second title in as many weeks.<br><br>\r\n\r\nDespite never feeling comfortable on Palmetto Country Club’s green complexes, the Georgia Tech senior made 18 birdies and an eagle en route to the win.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"I've been playing really good the last couple weeks. I hit the ball phenomenally this week. I just didn't have a real good feel for the greens out here – I didn't make many putts,\" he said. \"That kind of explains my slow start the last two days. I was 2 over on the front side pretty much both days. I just couldn't make a putt. Hit it pretty good, and then just really played good on the back. It was mostly ball-striking.

With the win, James repeated Phil's feat of winning on his home course.\r\n\r\n\"I grew up watching this tournament,\" said Pleat to the New Hampshire Golf Association. \"I remember the green before the one I won on, my dad won the 1997 State Amateur and I ran out to give him a hug and it was a little bit of a role reversal this time. He was caddying for me and we had a nice little hug on the 17th hole.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's amazing, it's a dream come true.\"\r\n\r\nIt wasn't easy though. After finishing the morning round 2 holes ahead, Pleat built a four-hole lead with just five to play. But Sheedy went on a run, winning three straight holes to pull within one with two holes to go. But a missed short par putt on the 35th hole was the decider.\r\n\r\n\"I think I escaped with one there\", said Pleat. \"I expected him to get up and down for par, but it was enough and that's all that matters and I'm thrilled.\"\r\n\r\nSheedy actually beat Phil Pleat during his run to the final match, but couldn't quite take out the father-son duo. It's a duo that have played great golf for many years now; in 2012 they became just the fourth father-son duo to play in the same U.S. Amateur, and they competed in the U.S. Four-Ball Championship in 2017. In addition to his three state amateur titles, Phil was the runner-up in the U.S. Senior Amateur.\r\n\r\nJames' grandfather Thomas J. Leonard, Jr. won eight New Hampshire state amateurs between 1939 and 1952, and his great grandfather Thomas J. Leonard, Sr. won in 1922.",

It was back and forth,” Robbins told the Carolinas Golf Association. “Walker [Jones] and Peter [Fountain] both played great. I knew playing those last five holes at even par wasn’t going to win it. I would have liked to get a couple more birdies than just one, but it was good enough. I was able to get ahead, hold off the competition, and get the job done.”\r\n\r\nThe one birdie was just enough to get the win as Robbins -- a redshirt freshman at UNC Wilmington -- took the crown with a 17-under 271. Both Jones and Fountain finished at 16-under to split second place.\r\n\r\nMaking birdies on Nos. 6 and 7, Robbins was looking for the 13th and final lead change of the tournament as he was one shot back of Fountain through No. 10. Gaining strokes on Nos. 11, 13, and 15, Robbins gained control before a weather delay slowed his momentum.\r\n\r\nThe delay may have been a saving grace for Robbins as Jones stayed stagnant with eight pars on the final nine holes and Fountain could only muster one birdie on the final three holes following the delay.\r\n\r\n“It means a lot. It’s been a rough past year-and-a-half or so with injuries and all the stuff that happened this past season with it getting canceled,” Robbins said. “I only had two opportunities to play in tournaments this summer, and I won them both, so I think I took advantage of a weird summer pretty well.”",

After a 10-foot birdie putt tied things up on the 18th hole, the pair headed back out to the 18th tee.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNot settling for a par as he had on the par-5 18th all week, Schniederjans played aggressively.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“Where the tee was on 18 today, it was like total match play (for the playoff), so I just decided to be aggressive,” said Schniederjans. “I hit 3-wood off the tee. On the second shot, I had some mud on the left side (of the ball), so I just tried to play a little cut with a 4-iron. (Barron) had gotten up and down on the last hole, so I figured I needed to two-putt. It was a tough two-putt, I had to hit a delicate putt down there (on the eagle attempt).”<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/L1wNF3X2NuM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>\r\n\r\nNestling the long eagle attempt to inside two feet, Schniederjans tapped in for birdie and awaited Barron’s 12-foot birdie putt.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nGiving it a run, Barron missed the putt giving Schniederjans the third win for a Yellow Jacket in eight days (<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/64502/Tyler-Strafaci\">Tyler Strafaci</a> won the North & South and Palmetto Amateurs).<br><br>\r\n\r\nBattling all day with Barron, Schniederjans reflected on his even-par final round.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t hitting bad shots, but out here, every putt you have outside of 10 feet is (playing) defense. So you have to stuff it, and it’s tough to stuff it when the pins are where they were. I wasn’t thinking it was very good, but it ended being a good score. I made some clutch par putts that I had to make.”",

This left room for Moore and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/64206/Alex-Chin\">Alex Chin</a>.\r\n\r\nMoore, 38, had a one-shot advantage over Chin as they came to the par-5 18th. Chin, playing aggressively, reached the green in two. The University of San Francisco senior tapped in a three-foot eagle putt to tie Moore at 8-under. Needing a nine-foot birdie to drop, Moore clutched up and drilled the putt for the win.\r\n\r\n“It was fun. That’s why we’re out here,” said Moore, whose 205 total matched the championship record. “It’s pretty close to one of my best tournament rounds out here.”\r\n\r\nMoore’s win at the Northern California Amateur is his second in three years as he took home the 2018 crown over good friend Matt Cohn. Cohn finished just two shots back of Moore on Sunday.\r\n\r\nThe 2015 NCGA player of the year has had quite a struggle personally after losing his grandmother in 2019. Albeit in the midst of a pandemic, getting back to the winner’s circle allows Moore to have a sense of normalcy once again.\r\n\r\n“The key is to continue to believe in yourself,” Moore said. “Knowing that you’re going to get through the bad times.”",

    "teaser": "Scott Turner is the 2nd player in the tourney's 45-year history to repeat; not bad for a player forced to take off two months",
    "articleText": "Three and a half weeks ago, Scott Turner couldn’t make a birdie when he shot 75 at The Fox Club and failed to qualify for the Florida Open. Now, 25 days later, he’s only the second player in the 45-year history of the Palm Beach Kennel Club/County Amateur Championship to win the title in back-to-back seasons.\r\n\r\n          Turner, of Stuart, started and finished the final round at The Dye Preserve with a two-stroke lead, closing with a one under par 71 for 206, matching his winning score at the Lost Tree Club a year ago.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n          “I give my pro (Rod Curl Jr., at Hammock Creek) a lot of credit for this win today,” Turner said Sunday afternoon. “I didn’t play for a couple of months because of the coronavirus pandemic when all the golf courses were closed and I stayed home because we (Scott and wife Stephanie) have an 11-month daughter (Kennedy) and I didn’t want her to catch anything.\r\n\r\n          “So I came out pretty rusty when I started playing again and Rod worked with me for three days in a row last week and it made a big difference.”\r\n\r\n          Talk about something making a big difference. In Sunday’s final round, Turner hit 3-iron off the tee at the par-3 seventh and the ball sailed left of the green, about a foot out of bounds. Later, Turner hit the same 3-iron on the green at the par-3 17th to about 20 feet, then had a tap-in par putt. He had just birdied the 15th and 16th holes, then parred the 18th as a sudden rainstorm swept through the area for the win.\r\n\r\n          “I guess that 3-iron redeemed itself,” he said with a smile.\r\n\r\n          The only other back-to-back winner in County Amateur history was Bill McDonough of Wellington in 1985-86 on the East course at JDM CC, once known as PGA National but now called BallenIsles. A few months later, McDonough qualified for the senior tour but came home a year later paraphrasing the PGA Tour slogan, “Those guys are good!”\r\n\r\n          The next goal for Turner, owner-operator of the Minor League Golf Tour, is the four County Amateur titles by Tom Knapp of Tequesta between 1982 and 1991. Turner, McDonough and Knapp are the players to have won the County Amateur more than once.\r\n\r\n          Greg Etimos of Palm Beach Gardens and John Driscoll III of Lake Mary, tied for second after two rounds, two strokes behind Turner, finished second and third with 71-208 and 72-209, respectively. Etimos had four birdies and three bogeys Sunday, Driscoll four birdies, two bogeys and a double bogey.\r\n\r\n          Ryan Howison of Jupiter was the senior winner for the second year in a row and third time in the last four seasons, closing on 69-219, tied for 13th overall.",

    "articleText": "Pinehurst continues to play host to some of the best amateur golfers in the nation. This week, the women take their shot.\r\n\r\nTennessee junior Mikayla Bardwell leads the way alongside Vanderbilt’s Louise Yu and 16-year-old Megha Ganne.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAs all three carded 4-under 68s on Tuesday on Pinehurst No. 4 (Ganne on No. 2), Bardwell grabbed a photo of her card before handing it over to Tournament Coordinator Matt Nunez. Despite it being her first North & South Amateur, Bardwell was locked in.\r\n\r\nGoing out and coming back in at 34, Bardwell jotted down just one bogey on the par-3 14th. With a scorecard fit for framing, Bardwell compared her goals which she had in her phone notes to her scorecard.\r\n\r\n“I was really excited to come to Pinehurst, and I really love this No. 4 course,” Bardwell told Pinehurst’s Alex Podlogar. “The shape of No. 4, it’s really a course where you have to know your lines, know exactly where you’re hitting it, and I feel really confident hitting my lines right now.”\r\n\r\nLouise Yu started hot on Tuesday, kicking off the tournament with three birdies on her first five holes. Taking a slight detour on No. 7, Yu made a double-bogey before making her fourth birdie of the front nine on No. 8. As she rolled over to the back nine, Yu played consistently with seven pars and two birdies to sit atop the leaderboard after day one.\r\n\r\nHaving a ‘go-to’ yardage on the golf course is common. Whether it be laying up to hit a full wedge or having a favorite par-3, plenty of confidence can come in the form of a yardage.\r\n\r\nMegha Ganna was able to capitalize on consistency on Tuesday doing just that.\r\n\r\n“For some reason, on those holes, I just kept getting 106 for the yardage,” Ganne said.\r\n\r\nSeeing the number through her range finder on three consecutive holes (No. 11-13) at Pinehurst No. 2, Ganne made the most of the opportunities.\r\n\r\n“The first time, I hit it great,” she said. “Then I got to do it again. Thankfully, that shot kept working and that number kept showing up.”\r\n\r\nGanne carded three of her five birdies over the three-hole stretch on her way to a three-way tie with 18-holes left to play before the event flips to match play.\r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of play on Wednesday, the event will crown a medalist before trimming the field of 96 to 16 as the event will begin match play on Thursday. 26 players are either at or below par, setting up a mad dash for the 'Sweet 16' on Wednesday. Play resumes at 7:00 am EST.",

Ivy Shepherd carded a 2-under 70 on No. 2, good for a tie for third.\r\n\r\nThe two finished their rounds of 66 and 69 respectively at Pinehurst No. 4 to match each other at 139. Heck, a former AJGA player of the year, carded the round of the day and matched up with her good friend Shepherd to crown a medalist.\r\n\r\nPlaying the par-4 14th at Pinehurst No. 2, Shepherd and Heck chirped each other on the tee box.\r\n\r\n“I could barely swing my driver, I was still laughing,” Heck told Pinehurst’s Alex Podlogar.\r\n\r\nShepherd made quick work of Heck, who is a phenom out of Memphis and has twice made cuts on the LPGA Tour. The Clemson Tiger birdied the playoff hole, making a 20-foot putt from the left fringe to earn medalist honors and the No. 1 seed.\r\n\r\n“It was going to be rolling about 8 feet past, but it hit the pin, thank God,” Shepherd said. “So, thankfully, it was over quick.”\r\n\r\nAs the event now shifts to match play, anything can happen. The highly touted field, which includes top-ranked Emilia Migliaccio (14-seed) will sort a champion through five rounds of match-play. Play resumes at 7:00 am EST with Shepherd facing off against 32-seed Annika Borreli.",

    "teaser": "On a difficult day when 35 players couldn't break 80, Aman Gupta and William Mouw lead at 3 under",
    "articleText": "Maridoe played tough Wednesday to open up the 114th Southern Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\nOnly 16 competitors sit below par and just eight carded even-par rounds. Leading the way heading into round two is Oklahoma State’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21354/Aman-Gupta?p=1\">Aman Gupta</a> and Pepperdine’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24757/William-Mouw?p=1\">William Mouw</a>. The duo posted matching 69s to kick off the tournament.\r\n\r\nGupta, a rising junior, was off to a slow start on Wednesday making back-to-back bogeys on holes 6 and 7 before kicking his game into gear with birdies on holes 10, 13, and 14. Capping his round off with another birdie on 18, Gupta holds a share of the lead at 3-under and will tee off at 1:50 pm CT on No. 10.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“I started off kind of shaky, not hitting it that great,” Gupta told the Southern Golf Association. “My momentum changed on 10 by hitting at the flag, making a 15-foot putt. Overall it was a great day.”\r\n\r\nCo-leader Mouw had split success on Wednesday. Beginning his day on No. 10, he negated bogeys on holes 12 and 17 with birdies on 14 and 16. Bogey free the rest of the way, Mouw posted birdies on holes 2, 3, and 7 to round out his opening 18. Playing with defending champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21300/A-J--Ott?p=1\">A.J. Ott</a>, he tees off of No. 1 at 8:00 am CT.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the 2019 champ, Ott could not find the same success he had last year. Making a birdie on just his second hole of the day, Ott struggled as he bogeyed five of his next seven holes. Unable to gain strokes back on his final nine, Ott double-bogeyed two holes and birdied three more to minimize the damage. His 5-over 77 is not ideal, but he is far from being out of contention as just 35 golfers broke 80.\r\n\r\nMaridoe Junior champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21442/Michael-Brennan?p=1\">Michael Brennan</a> is among those on the cusp of par. Going out in 35, he was unable to keep his round in the red down the stretch. Bogeys on three of the four final holes kept him out of a potential tie for third. Instead, Brennan will tee off Thursday four shots off the lead as he currently sits in a tie for 25th at 1-over.\r\n\r\nPlay resumes at 7:00 am CT. A cut from 156 to the top 66 and ties will be made following the conclusion of play on Thursday.\r\n\r\nThe Southern Amateur is the latest stop on the road to the U.S. Amateur at Bandon Dunes. Both the winner and runner(s) up will earn exemptions into the national championship.",

    "articleText": "Wake Forest’s Rachel Kuehn is making a run with arguably the best caddie at Pinehurst.\r\n\r\nThe Demon Deacon sophomore is turning heads with 30-year Pinehurst veteran caddie Keith Silva. The duo took down Bentley Cotton 2 up in the opening round of match play on Thursday. A feat that neither claims they did alone.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“Everybody’s telling me I’ve got the best caddie,” Kuehn told Pinehurst’s Alex Podlogar. “I’ve only known Keith for four days, and already I trust him with everything. Just give me the number and the line, and I’ll try to do that. If I miss, it’s my fault, not his.”\r\n\r\nHaving not met until this week, Silva had high hopes for the Wake Forest star.\r\n\r\n“I knew what kind of player I had just from the two practice rounds on No. 2 and No. 4,” Silva said. “A few members came up to me and asked if I had a good player. I told them, ‘If we don’t make it to match play, I’m going to pack it up.’”\r\n\r\nAt 70-years old, no one would blame Silva for hanging up his bib. However, his success with amateurs over the past 11-months would make people wonder ‘Why retire now?’. On the bag for William Holcomb’s semifinal run at last August’s U.S. Amateur and the North & South Amateur Championship runner-up finish just a couple weeks ago gave Silva a rejuvenated outlook.\r\n\r\n“Really, they’re all just making me look good,” Silva quipped.\r\n\r\nKuehn has a tendency to make anyone looping for her look good. As one of the top-ranked juniors in the 2019 class, she made five appearances in her COVID-19 shortened freshman season notching top-20 finishes in each event and taking home the ANNIKA Intercollegiate title.\r\n\r\nAs the 10-seed, Kuehn will play 26-seed Becca DiNunzio who bested junior golf star Megha Ganne 3 & 2 on Thursday.\r\n\r\n“Let’s play 36 tomorrow, OK, kid?” Silva told Kuehn as they walked off the 18th at No. 2.\r\n\r\nMedalist Ivy Shepherd kept rolling along with a 2 & 1 win over Annika Borrelli to set up a match with Duke star Gina Kim in the Round of 16. Kuehn’s teammate and top-ranked female in the AmateurGolf.com rankings, Emilia Migliaccio advanced 3 & 2 over Lei Ye. Auburn’s hot-handed Megan Schofill, on the heels of her 10-stroke comeback at the Florida Women’s Amateur advanced 1-up over Round 1 co-leader, Mikayla Bardwell.\r\n\r\nPlay resumes at 7:00 am ET as the field will be cut from 16 to four by the end of Friday.",

    "articleText": "Frankie Capan scrambled to rally as the final round of the Minnesota State Amateur came to a close.\r\n\r\nLearning from last week’s blown lead at the Minnesota State Open which saw University of Minnesota’s Angus Flanagan pull away from Capan who could not recover from a couple of final round bogeys, he nearly repeated himself at Edina Country Club on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nCapan floundered away his lead twice in the final round but overcame his mistakes to post a one-under 71 to come away with the victory.\r\n\r\n“It always feels good to win and hoist a trophy at the end of the day,” Capan told Nick Hunter of the Minnesota Golf Association, “but I wish I had a couple shots back.”\r\n\r\nCapan continued to say that his game is “feeling good” following last week’s tough loss and that he “really wanted this one” when talking about the Minnesota Amateur.\r\n\r\nTreading water on the front nine, Capan made the turn at even-par on the day. As those who started the day behind him began to climb the leaderboard, Capan knew it was time to make some moves.\r\n\r\nCapan tightened his belt to post a 1-under back nine, sealing the deal with two clutch pars on holes 17 and 18 to claim the Minnesota Amateur by two strokes over North Dakota State senior and defending MGA Players’ champion, Andrew Israelson, who made a charge with a final round 65.\r\n\r\nCapan, who is transferring to Florida Gulf Coast later this fall, made the decision to leave Alabama to team up with his close friend and final round playing partner Van Holmgren.\r\n\r\n“Florida is a great place and I’ve always felt as though I’d eventually like to move there, assuming I go on to play professional golf,” Capan said. “After I made the decision to leave Alabama, he [Holmgren] and I went down to Florida Gulf Coast and checked it out and felt it was the best place for me.”",

    "articleText": "A pair of 2019 Mass Golf Championship winners both have a chance to win their first Massachusetts Amateur title Friday.\r\n\r\nManchester’s Nick Maccario (Bradford Country Club), the 2019 Mass Mid-Amateur champion, and Sudbury’s Matthew Organisak (Nashawtuc Country Club), the 2019 Ouimet Memorial Tournament champion, have survived two days of stroke play and two days of match play. Now they will compete for the 112th Massachusetts Amateur title in the 36-hole final match, which begins at 8 a.m. Friday at The Kittansett Club.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nOn a bright and breezy day at The Kittansett Club, both men rallied back to win their quarterfinal matches and played 18 more holes to decide who would advance to the finals. Maccario defeated stroke-play co-medalist Matt Parziale (Thorny Lea), of Brockton, and Organisak took down Amesbury’s Chris Francoeur (Amesbury G&CC), also co-medalist.\r\n\r\nCoincidentally, it’s also the first time in the past decade that two players in the same stroke play group made the finals together.\r\n\r\n<b>Semifinal Recap</b>\r\n\r\n<u>Match 29: 4-Matthew Organisak def. 1-Chris Francouer (Amesbury G&CC), 1-up</u>\r\n\r\nNo matter the situation, Matthew Organisak’s strategy throughout the Massachusetts Amateur has been the same.\r\n\r\n“Just keep the ball in front of you,” Organisak said. “If you keep the ball in front of you, don’t make any mistakes, then as long as you play OK, things will go alright.”\r\n\r\nThough Organisak, a left-handed golfer, saw his 3-up lead evaporate after Francouer won holes 15, 16 and 17 with an eagle, birdie and par, he hit his next tee shot in the middle off the fairway.\r\n\r\nFrancouer didn’t. His tee shot got swept up by the wind blowing from left to right, and he lost it in the trees and had to play his provisional ball from the fairway. Organisak hit his next shot about 20 feet above the pin, and after Francoeur missed his fifth shot, a long putt from the back of the green, he took off his hat and conceded the match.\r\n\r\n“I just tried to do what I could to keep it from cutting too much,” Francoeur said of his shot on the 18th. “Even the second one, I thought I hit a hard draw into the wind and it still cut into the right rough so it’s just a tough wind and the wrong time to make a bad swing.”\r\n\r\nWith the match tied through 10, Organisak capitalized on three Francoeur bogeys. Francoeur hit his tee shot into the bunker on the 13th and missed the green on the par-3 14th to drop both holes. But then he rallied, riffling his tee shot down the middle on the 15th, getting on in two and making the 18-foot eagle putt. Perhaps his best shot came on 16, when his approach shot into the wind hit perfectly behind the pin a rolled back to above three feet.\r\n\r\nBoth drives were in the right rough on the 17th, and their second shots were behind the green. However, Francouer chipped about 2 feet to the hole, while Organisak’s was well short, and he missed his par putt.\r\n\r\nJust like the wind often does at Kittansett, his luck turned quickly as he hit found his way to 18 and didn’t even have to attempt his eagle putt to win it.\r\n\r\n“I was very pleased with how I hit the two golf shots on 18 and how I had a good shot to win it there,” Organisak said.\r\n\r\nAnd after already playing 36 holes of stroke play with Maccario, the two will meet for what could be another 36 holes Friday. Only this time the stakes are much higher.\r\n\r\n“We had a blast the three of us,” Organisak said. “I’m looking forward to it, hoping we can hit some good golf shots.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n<u>Match 30: 14-Nick Maccario (Bradford CC) def. 2-Matt Parziale (Thorny Lea GC), 1-up</u>\r\n\r\nNick Maccario’s path to his first Mass Amateur championship final has been far from easy this year. He had to knock off defending champion Steven DiLisio (Salem CC) in the Round of 16 and Benjamin Spitz (George Wright GC) in the quarterfinals. He then saved his best for last by knocking off 2017 champion Matt Parziale, overcoming an early three-hole deficit.\r\n\r\nIt’s certainly not easy to carry yourself this far into the championship.\r\n\r\n“My feet are killing me,” Maccario said after his victory. “So tiring, but it was awesome. Mackenzie (Murphy) who’s on the bag, she was awesome. It was a battle every single one, but honestly, I put enough pressure on that I always had to keep my focus because these guys today.”\r\n\r\nMaccario was the one under pressure early, falling behind by three strokes to Parziale. But things changed when he won the eighth and ninth to make it 1-up.\r\n\r\n“It was nice to get that one back get one on nine, and then get into the back nine only one down, I kind of told myself if I could be on the last three holes pretty much even that’d be a good goal to set.”\r\n\r\nHe then took the lead on the 16th by making birdie into the wind. On the 18th, Parziale’s second shot landed off the green to the left, but he pitched on within a few feet, and Parziale missed his putt to end it.\r\n\r\nThough he couldn’t make the finals like 2008 at Kittansett, Parziale said he’s excited for future events, including the 2020 U.S. Amateur, which begins August 10 at Bandon Dunes Golf Resort.\r\n\r\n“I played well all week,” Parziale said. “I’m looking forward to getting out there, and we got some more stuff before that comes.”\r\n\r\nAs for playing Organisak, Maccario expects it to just come down to ball placement once again.\r\n\r\n“His game was super impressive during stroke play,” Maccario said. “Tomorrow is going to be more of the same, just a grind.”",

That is what it will take to win the 114th Southern Amateur at Maridoe Country Club.\r\n\r\nWilliam Mouw has followed that blueprint to a tee as he took the solo lead after two days of play. The Pepperdine sophomore carded a second-round 67, improving on his opening 69 that earned him a co-leader moniker at the conclusion of Wednesday’s round.\r\n\r\nMouw started hot before the Texas heat kicked in. Teeing off at 8:00 am, he tallied four birdies on his first seven holes to go out in 32. Without a stumble for 13 holes, Mouw carded his first bogey of the day on No. 14, his lone bogey on the day. Immediately fixing his mistake, Mouw circled two straight birdies on Nos. 15 and 16 to settle in with a 5-under 67.\r\n\r\nOvernight first-round co-leader Aman Gupta did not have near the fortune Mouw had on Thursday. The Oklahoma State Cowboy posted a 4-over 76 to fall from a tie for first, to a tie for 24th.\r\n\r\nGupta’s Big 12 foes from Austin, Texas had a big day on Thursday.\r\n\r\nThe Coody brothers, Parker and Pierceson made big moves during the second round. Parker Coody improved his opening 70 with a 68 to move into solo third. Pierceson tied the low-round of the day to get to red numbers with a 67. He begins Friday’s round at 1-under in a tie for 12th.\r\n\r\nUT star Cole Hammer matched Pierceson Coody with a 67 to move into a tie for sixth. Rising sophomore Travis Vick shot a 68 to move to 4-under on the tournament and slides into a tie for fourth. Of the five Longhorns in the event, Will Thomson was the only one to miss the cut.\r\n\r\nDefending champion AJ Ott will not get the opportunity to play on the weekend as he was unable to overcome a 5-over first round. Tallying a second round 73, Ott missed the weekend by a stoke.\r\n\r\nThe same cannot be said for the 2020 Maridoe Junior champions, Michael Brennan.

    "articleText": "By Matty Madden for the VSGA\r\n\r\nFor the second year in a row, a junior golfer has won the VSGA Women’s Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\nTatum Walsh (Salisbury CC), age 17, was crowned the 95th VSGA Women’s Amateur champion after defeating stroke-play qualifying medalist Julie Shin 5 and 3 in the 18-hole championship match Thursday afternoon at Roanoke Country Club. To get to the final, she had to outlast Melanie Walker (Springfield G&CC) in a 19-hole semifinal shootout.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThis is Walsh’s first major tournament win. She described it as her biggest win ever, saying that even just getting into the finals was the biggest accomplishment of her career so far. Walsh credited her massive improvement from last summer to a change in her swing and an increase in her confidence saying, “the swing change definitely helped, but really it was just gaining confidence, playing more, and practicing.”\r\n\r\nHer matchup with Walker, a 2019 semifinalist, went into extra holes. Walker and Walsh were tied after 18 holes, after Walker hit a branch on a fairway shot, giving Walsh the advantage on the green. Walker sank a long putt to win the hole and tie it up. Walker and Walsh made their way back to the first hole, where Walsh made birdie to claim the victory.\r\n\r\nOn tying it up on the 18th hole, Walsh said, “Nerves are definitely there, but you’ve just got to find a way to contain them.”\r\n\r\nShin defeated 4th seed Kendall Turner (Greenbrier CC) 2 and 1 in the semifinals to advance. It was a back and forth contest that saw Turner come back to tie it up on the 15th hole, only to drop two straight holes to Shin.\r\n\r\nIn the championship match, Shin and Walsh started off tied for the first two holes, but after Walsh won the 3rd hole with a birdie, Shin never recovered, only coming within two holes of Walsh for the remainder of the match. Walsh said nerves were still present even after going 4 up with four holes to play.\r\n\r\nWalsh is currently verbally committed to James Madison University and will join the team after she graduates high school in 2021. Walsh said this win definitely gives her confidence as she gets closer to starting her college golf career.\r\n\r\nThe Women’s amateur featured three additional flights, where competitors who did not qualify for the championship brackets got a chance to compete in match play. The first flight was won by Ester Choi (VSGA Junior Golf Circuit), who defeated hometown golfer Kaitlyn Mosdell (Roanoke CC) 3 and 2 in the finals. The second flight was won by Caleigh Street (VSGA Junior Golf Circuit) who defeated youngest in the field, 11-year old Ashnoor Kaur (VSGA Junior Golf Circuit) 3 and 2 in the final round. The last flight was won by Rachel Detore (Lee’s Hill GC), who beat out Angela Baskette (Army Navy CC) 4 and 3 in the final round.",

Always looking forward to the final round while in contention, Coody is even more excited to tee it up with his college teammate.\r\n\r\n“It’s going to be fun, it’s going to be just like qualifying,” Coody told AmateurGolf.com following his third-round 72. “It’s my home course but it’s still a stressful day. Having your teammate play with you is just going to be fun. It’s going to be a good grouping.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nCoody’s even-par round had its ups and downs. Kicking things off with an eagle on the par-5 second hole, he tallied two bogeys and a birdie for a front-side 35. Making the turn uneventfully, Coody coasted with pars until he chalked up a birdie on the par-3 14th. Unable to keep the momentum going, Coody posted back-to-back bogeys on Nos. 15 and 16 to end the day with the same score he began it with; 8-under-par.\r\n\r\nHammer continued his good play, following up his 67 on Thursday with a 68 to jump four players and take the lead. Hammer made six birdies on the day, including four of his first six holes, to put himself in position to win his first major tournament since last year's NCAA Regional.\r\n\r\nOne shot back of his teammate Hammer, Coody feels he has plenty to improve on as he heads into the final round.\r\n\r\n“I missed quite a bit of putts inside about six or seven feet,” Coody said. “Not that I was misreading them, I was just hitting poor putts and that’s something I can easily clean up and improve on tomorrow.”\r\n\r\nCoody won last year's Trans-Mississippi Championship on his home course of Maridoe and should feel like he has the advantage.\r\n\r\n36-hole leader <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24757/William-Mouw?p=1\">William Mouw</a> simply could not get anything going on Friday. The Pepperdine star had a rough start that set the tone for him. Three-straight bogeys on holes 2, 3, and 4 dropped Mouw from 8-under to 5-under in what seemed like a blink of an eye.\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Leader William Mouw (-8) tees off and we’re fully underway at The Southern Amateur. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AmateurGolf?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AmateurGolf</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/7V2jZokXqd\">pic.twitter.com/7V2jZokXqd</a></p>— Brayden Conover (@Brayden_AG) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Brayden_AG/status/1284131733538050050?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 17, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\n“I just felt a little rushed today,” Mouw said. “I’m excited for tomorrow, we’re not out of it.”\r\n\r\nJust three shots back of the lead, Mouw is still in the thick of things. His opening 69 and 67 helped offset his third-round 76, which closed with a double-bogey. Knowing how quickly a lead can change and momentum can shift, Mouw is comfortable with his positioning.\r\n\r\n“18 holes of golf is a lot of holes,” Mouw said. “You see three-shot leads go [away] in two, three holes so three shots is nothing. Go out there and compete with some of the best amateurs out there and see who comes out on top.”\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/23427/David-Perkins?p=1\">David Perkins</a> (East Peoria, Ill.) is two shots back in third after a 74. Mouw is tied for fourth, three shots back, alongside <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22039/Clay-Merchant?p=1\">Clay Merchent</a> (Noblesville, Ind.) and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/17277/Cooper-Dossey?p=1\">Cooper Dossey</a> (Austin, Texas).\r\n\r\nMerchent may have the most to gain from anyone on Saturday.

All of that changed on Friday.\r\n\r\nThe Alabama senior was as hot as the Texas sun. Posting a 6-under 66, Furr thrust himself into contention.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been struggling with my wedges coming into the event,” Furr told AmateurGolf.com following his round. “I went and saw my [swing] coach and we’ve been working on them.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHis wedges were definitely working on Friday as the highlight of his round came on Furr’s tenth hole of the day, the par-4 1st. Holing out from 144-yards for an eagle, Furr knocked down three more birdies to just one bogey on his final nine holes.\r\n\r\n“It was awesome,” Furr said. “I had 144 into the wind a little bit and just flighted a pitching wedge in there, landed right behind it, and spun right in.”\r\n\r\nOpening on No. 10 with a bogey, Furr immediately gained the drop stroke back with a birdie on No. 11 before circling two more birdies on Nos. 14 and 17. With the 66, Furr owns the lowest round of the Southern Amateur so far. Fellow competitor and home-course hero <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22195/Pierceson-Coody?p=1\">Pierceson Coody</a> held the competitive course record prior to the Maridoe Samaritan Fund Invitational earlier this year.\r\n\r\nCoody carded a 66 at the 2019 Trans-Mississippi last summer to set the course record last July. The record stood until April when PGA Tour pros came to Maridoe to play in the Maridoe Samaritarian Fund Invitational. <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/14160/Viktor-Hovland?p=1\">Viktor Hovland</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/14176/Will-Zalatoris?p=1\">Will Zalatoris</a> posted matching 65s in the final round of the MSFI 1.0. Stephen Yeager broke their records with a competitive round of 64 shortly after.\r\n\r\nWith a successful moving day out of the way, Furr is ready to get back on the course for Saturday’s final round.\r\n\r\n“I feel like my game’s good,” Furr said. “I’m just going to go out and try to make some birdies.”",

    "teaser": "In his first event since his college career was cut short, Matt Organisak outlasted Nick Maccario in a marathon 36-hole final",
    "articleText": "When he held the Massachusetts Cup for the first time, Sudbury’s Matthew Organisak (Nashawtuc Country Club) looked down at it and stared. The past winners of this trophy include Mass Golf Hall of Famers Francis Ouimet, Fred Wright and Frank Vana, Jr.\r\n\r\nAfter battling Waltham’s Nick Maccario (Bradford Country Club) through a grueling 36 holes in the Massachusetts Amateur championship match at the Kittansett Club — first with heavy rain and then with heavy wind — the left-handed phenom earned himself a spot on the trophy with a 2-up victory that ended with Maccario conceding the 18th hole.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“It’s truly special to be able to say that my name will be on this trophy pretty soon,” said Organisak, a 22-year-old recent graduate of Emory University. “Something that I feel even better about and even more proud and happy about is that the Nashawtuc Country’s Club’s name will be on this trophy. Every member over there has always been so supportive and they have been all week you know I got a bunch of texts yesterday, telling me good luck tomorrow.”\r\n\r\nThe first 18 holes ended in a tie, with both men winning five holes apiece. Organisak won four of the first six holes over the next 18 holes and never trailed. He birdied the 9th (27th overall) and 10th (28th) to take a 4-up lead. Maccario won the 12th (30th) and 13th (31st) and made birdie on the 17th (35th) to cut it to 1 up, but Organisak was on the 18th (36th) green in three, and Maccario conceded after missing his par putt.\r\n\r\nIt was an inspiring win for Organisak, who was playing in his first tournament since COVID-19 caused the cancelation of the rest of his college season.\r\n\r\n“Last week I started putting myself in preparation mode and started really thinking about shots and things and places and decisions that I’d have to make in the tournament and tournament play,” Organisak said. “I played pretty well on Monday, and I went home and I packed a big bag with a lot of clothes. I said, ‘I hope I got to use all these,’ and I don’t have any clean clothes left so that’s a good thing. I just had a good feeling. You know if you come in and you believe in yourself, you never know.”\r\n\r\nThis is the first state amateur win for Organisak, who joins 1968 champion Mike Ohanian as the only other person to win it while representing Nashawtuc. He’s the first to win the Ouimet Memorial Tournament and then ensuing the Mass Amateur since PGA Professional Jim Salinetti (1999-00).\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nOrganisak also joins Patrick Frodigh (2018) and Ben Spitz (2006) as the only left-handed golfers to win it since 2000.\r\n\r\nMaccario, the 2019 Mass Mid-Amateur champion, said the hardest part of the tournament was Friday.\r\n\r\n“Playing and keeping the adrenaline and the energy up for 36 is tough,” he said. “I’ve never had to do it while playing the same person. It was tough and the weather today felt like we were not in the U.S. We had a little bit of everything. I think that was probably the toughest thing was just keeping your head in it for eight hours.”\r\n\r\nThis final match concludes the week-long competition, which was the first statewide championship event held during the COVID-19 era.",

The Vandalia, Ohio, native bested the previous Ohio Amateur record by two strokes. Ben Curtis set the mark at 16 under in 2000, when he won the second of his consecutive Ohio Amateur titles.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD> Greaser had two top-six finishes for the Tar Heels last season (second at the Turning Stone Invitational in Verona, N.Y., and sixth at Notre Dame). He won the 114th Ohio Amateur by eight strokes. Bryce Haney of Huber Heights, Ohio, was second at 10 under. Greaser made eight birdies and only one bogey for a 7-under-par 65 in Tuesday's opening-round and followed with 69-66-70 over the next three days to finish at 18 under 270. He made 19 birdies, two eagles and bogeys over the four rounds.

    "articleText": "The attack of the Mac bested one of the most elite amateur fields of the summer.\r\n\r\nSMU’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22047/McClure-Meissner?p=1\">McClure ‘Mac’ Meissner</a> began the final round of the 114th Southern Amateur seven shots behind 54-hole leader <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/15400/Cole-Hammer?p=1\">Cole Hammer</a> (Texas). \r\n\r\nMeissner’s game plan for the final round was to just stay steady and let the course come to him. \r\n\r\n“My mindset was to make as many birdies as I could,” Meissner told AmateurGolf.com after turning in his scorecard to take the clubhouse lead, “and take advantage of the holes that they give you chances on.”\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SL4WY0Y1LO0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n\r\nHe didn’t even think he would be in a position to win. Looking to go a couple under par, Meissner surprised himself when he made the turn. Posting a front-side 4-under 32, Meissner thought to himself “I’ve got a chance here”.\r\n\r\nWith his dad Kurt on his bag, the duo saved their best work for last.\r\n\r\nMaking his lone bogey of the day on No. 10, Meissner rallied with three straight birdies on holes 12-14 before parring out to tie the low-round of the tournament with a 66.\r\n\r\n“It was all working pretty well,” Meissner said when asked what the best part of his game was on Saturday.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAs Hammer and fellow Longhorn <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22195/Pierceson-Coody?p=1\">Pierceson Coody</a> struggled to continue their pace, the third wheel of the final group rose to the occasion.\r\n\r\nIllinois State senior <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/23427/David-Perkins?p=1\">David Perkins</a> felt like it was him against the world as he was paired with Hammer and Coody. Coody, a member at Maridoe, had as big of a gallery as COVID-19 protocols would allow.\r\n\r\n“I definitely had some nerves to start,” Perkins said. “Mostly it was knowing that nobody really wanted me to win.”\r\n\r\nHalf joking, Perkins stayed within himself during a round that he says was not his best performance. Pushing his own bag, Perkins three-putted twice on the front nine en route to an even-par 36. With not much going positively or negatively, he finally got the spark he was looking for on the par-5 16th.\r\n\r\nMaking an eagle, Perkins piqued the interest of everyone with two holes remaining.\r\n\r\nHitting two “perfect” shots to leave as easy a chip as one could have on the glass-like greens at Maridoe, Perkins’ ball found the bottom of the cup before he needed his putter.\r\n\r\nComing away with par on 17, Perkins had a similar situation on the closing hole. Coming up short on his approach, Perkins had about 15-yards to the flag. He nearly holed out for the win. Tapping in for par and a final round 70, he headed back to the 18th tee to face Meissner as the pair tied at 7-under.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nBoth hit the fairway, but Perkins went first on the approach. Leaving it short and right just as he had done in regulation, the pressure was on Meissner to hit the green.\r\n\r\nDoing so from about 155 yards, Meissner left himself a 20-foot birdie putt and a near-lock par. Perkins two-putted following his chip, leaving the stage for Meissner to claim victory. Drilling an ever so stressful three-footer, Meissner was named the 2020 Southern Amateur champ.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had a lot of good finishes in my junior and college career,” Meissner said following the playoff, “but I haven’t really gotten it done much… It gives me a ton of confidence knowing that I’m good enough to be out here. I’ve always struggled with that a bit.”\r\n\r\nAlready exempt, both he and Perkins earned exemptions in next month's U.S. Amateur at Bandon Dunes. <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22039/Clay-Merchent?p=1\">Clay Merchent</a> (Noblesville, Ind.) had a golden opportunity to punch his ticket to the national championship and claim the Southern Amateur trophy at Maridoe. Merchent, who is not exempt, needed a win or a runner-up finish to make it to Bandon Dunes, and with six holes left to play he was eight under and found himself leading the field by three shots. But two doubles and two bogeys coming in dropped him back into a tie for fourth with <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/159495/Junmin-Lee\">Junmin Lee</a> of Bryan, Texas.\r\n\r\nOklahoma’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/17104/Quade-Cummins?p=1\">Quade Cummins</a> shot his third straight 70 to finish solo third, two shots out of the playoff.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/19645/John-Pak?p=1\">John Pak</a> (Scotch Plains, N.J.) tied for sixth with <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/16919/Julian-Perico?p=1\">Julian Perico</a> (Peru) and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/17727/Austin-Eckroat?p=1\">Austin Eckroat</a> (Edmond, Okla.).\r\n\r\nHammer (79) and Coody (77) both tumbled down the leaderboard as the expected duel between the Texas teammates never materialized.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/28034/Marcus-Jones?p=1\">Marcus Jones</a> (Argyle, Texas) took home low mid-am honors.",

    "articleText": "By Stan Cole\r\n\r\nIt’s only fitting that an extra hole was required Saturday afternoon to decide the 118th Women’s North & South Amateur at Pinehurst No. 2.\r\n\r\nBoth finalists <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/25625/Rachel-Kuehn?p=1\">Rachel Kuehn</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/9536/Allisen-Corpuz?p=1\">Allisen Corpuz</a> needed playoffs to reach Saturday afternoon’s final. Kuehn went 20 holes in her quarterfinal victory Friday afternoon while Corpuz had to play 21 before outlasting <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22853/Ivy-Shepherd?p=1\">Ivy Shepherd</a> in Saturday morning’s semifinal.\r\n\r\nToss in an 80-minute rain delay and Saturday’s play extended nearly 11 hours from the time Corpuz first teed off at 7:00 a.m.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nA par on the first playoff hole – the par-4 1st – gave Kuehn the North & South title and Putter Boy trophy 25 years after her mother, former Wake Forest Hall of Famer <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/2965/Brenda-Kuehn?p=1\">Brenda Corrie Kuehn</a>, finished just short of the championship in the 1995 event.\r\n\r\n“I joke with my mom because she finished (short), and has been holding that over my head,” said Kuehn with a laugh.  “I’m glad I could top her a little bit, but to add my name to the list of winners here is an unbelievable feeling.”\r\n\r\nWhile Kuehn had to play five fewer holes to reach the final, the tight competition combined with North Carolina Sandhills summer time weather extended the day.\r\n\r\n“The Pinehurst heat and more than 36 holes definitely makes it a game of endurance, especially when you’re playing two matches in a day,” said Kuehn, who earned All-America honors as a freshman at Wake Forest where she <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25594/Wake-Forest-leans-on-freshmen-in-taking-Annika-Invite-title\">won the prestigious ANNIKA Invitational</a> last September in her first collegiate start.\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Allisen Corpuz and Rachel Kuehn will both receive invites from the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USGA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@USGA</a> into this year’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/USWomensAmateur?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#USWomensAmateur</a>. <a href=\"https://t.co/NmeVtnQqYt\">pic.twitter.com/NmeVtnQqYt</a></p>— Pinehurst Resort (@PinehurstResort) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PinehurstResort/status/1284628370731552768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 18, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\nTwice before Saturday’s weather delay, Kuehn took two-hole leads only to see Corpuz pull square after 11.  After her 21-hole outing in the morning, Corpuz bogeyed the opening two holes of the final round before making five-straight pars – the third of which leveled the match through five.\r\n\r\nKuehn went back in front with a par on the long par-4 eighth; then the Asheville native rolled in a 10-footer on the par-3 ninth for the first birdie by either player of the afternoon.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Wake Forest sophomore left her next two tee shots in the right native area and lost the lead as Corpuz made two straight pars.  On the par-4 12th, Kuehn again left her drive in the right side natural area, but hit the green with her second shot to match Corpuz’ par.\r\n\r\nAs the golfers approached the 13th tee just after 3 p.m., play was halted as thunderstorms moved through the Sandhills region.\r\n\r\nNeither Kuehn nor Corpuz appeared to be affected by the delay as both hit the fairway, then took aim at the elevated green with their second shots on the par-4 13th.  However, Corpuz missed a 3-footer for par to drop the hole.\r\n\r\nThe Southern Cal senior rallied and closed the round with five straight pars, including a long two-putt on 17.  Kuehn just missed her par putt on the hole and the competitors stepped to the 18th tee all square.  Each hit fairway, green and two-putted to send the match to the playoff.\r\n\r\nCorpuz’ drive on her 40th hole of the day found the left native area and her footing was unsure as the native of Kapolei, Hawaii, set up for her second shot.  Corpuz’ hybrid bounced off the back of the green; then her chip was short and rolled off the slope.\r\n\r\nKuehn then two-putted from the front fringe to secure the title.\r\n\r\nThe delay might have come at an opportune time for Kuehn.\r\n\r\n“I actually wasn’t hitting the ball great going into the rain delay, so it gave me a chance to regroup and it kind of turned an 18-hole final match into a six-hole final match.”\r\n\r\nCorpuz, the 2019 North & South medalist who advanced to the quarterfinals of the event in the last two years, noted that the delay was “a little annoying to take a break, but it happens and you have to accept it and keep playing.”\r\n\r\nBoth Corpuz and Kuehn entered the Women’s North & South Amateur as qualifiers for the U.S. Women’s Amateur, which will be played Aug. 3-9 at Woodmont Country Club in Maryland.\r\n\r\n“I’m so proud of her play. She just never quits. She has a fire in her belly that never ends and you can never count her out because she’ll fight to the last drop,” said Brenda Corrie Kuehn, who competed in 16 U.S. Amateurs and nine U.S. Opens.\r\n\r\nEven with her vast golfing experience, Brenda allowed Rachel and her veteran Pinehurst caddie Keith Silva handle matters on the course.  Silva was on the bag at Pinehurst last year for <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22979/William-Holcomb?p=1\">William Holcomb V</a>’s run to the U.S. Amateur semifinal and two weeks ago as Holcomb finished as runner-up in the North & South.\r\n\r\n“We talked about things that were not golf. This was about (Rachel) and her caddie,” said Brenda. “The two of them made a great team.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n<b>Semifinals</b>\r\n\r\nCorpuz advanced to the final after making a 12-foot birdie putt on the 21st hole Saturday morning.  After she and Ivy Shepherd both saved par from the native area on the first two playoff holes, Corpuz hit a wedge from 105 yards to 12 feet to set up the deciding birdie on the short par-4 third hole.\r\n\r\nShepherd, the North & South medalist, made the turn Saturday morning 1-up, but the Corpuz tied the match three times on the back nine – the last with short par putt on the par-three 17th.\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t hitting the ball really well today; I was just trying to keep it in play and grind it out,” said Shepherd, a sophomore at Clemson. “I just missed a few important putts coming down the road. When it went to extra holes, I missed three really good birdie looks back-to-back-to-back.”\r\n\r\nFor her second straight match, Kuehn rallied to advance to the North & South final.  On Friday, she trailed Rachel Heck in her quarterfinal by two with four holes to play before squaring the match on the 18th and winning on the 20th hole.  On Saturday morning, Kuehn fell behind by two through five holes to Michigan State’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/25643/Haylin-Harris?p=1\">Haylin Harris</a> before the Wake Forest sophomore won three of the next five.\r\n\r\nKuehn birdied the par-5 eighth and par-3 ninth to take the lead, then won the 12th and 14th to build a three-hole lead with three to play.  Harris conceded after Kuehn knocked her approach on the par-four 16th tight.",

    "teaser": "Mark Lawrence is the 2nd player to win the Virginia state junior, amateur and open titles; the other is a World Golf Hall of Famer",
    "articleText": "By Chris Lang\r\n\r\nMark Lawrence Jr.’s historic blitz of Ballyhack Golf Club came to an end on Saturday afternoon with a tap-in for par at 18, giving him a three-day total of 200 and the championship at the Delta Dental State Open of Virginia. The victory was a long time coming for an accomplished amateur who has been agonizingly close to holding the Farmington Cup twice in the last five years.\r\n\r\nRichmond’s Lawrence, a member at Independence Golf Club who is set to complete his college golf career at Virginia Tech whenever the pandemic will allow, opened with a 9-under-par 63 on Thursday and never let anyone have a realistic hope of catching him. His steady 3-under 69 on Saturday left him with a place in the State Open record book, at least for the seven events held at Ballyhack.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHe shattered the previous low score of 204, set by Fielding Brewbaker and current PGA Tour member Lanto Griffin. His opening round tied his own Ballyhack competitive course record (also shared by Ballyhack member Justin Young, who shot a three-day 207 to finish second this week.) And he became the second member of an ultra-exclusive club of players who have won the State Open, VSGA Amateur and VSGA Junior Stroke Play championships.\r\n\r\nThe other? World Golf Hall of Famer Lanny Wadkins.\r\n\r\n“I’ll have to mention that to Bobby the next time I see him at Kinloch,” Lawrence joked, referring to Wadkins’ brother.\r\n\r\nTo anyone who has played with Lawrence lately, this week’s showing came of little surprise.\r\n\r\n“I played with him in the practice round, and I think everybody in our group saw this coming,” said Mikey Moyers, who shot a three-day 208 to finish third. “We were like, if he hits it like this, we have no chance. He hits hit higher and farther than all of us. There are certain shots you have to hit here high and with spin, and he can do that.\r\n\r\n“He was just playing a different game.”\r\n\r\nLawrence led by four strokes after Thursday and seven strokes when Friday’s suspended second round was completed early Saturday morning. His lead never dipped below four strokes in the final round. His bogey on No. 3 opened the door just a tiny crack, but he made key birdies on Nos. 5, 9 and 11 to slam it shut once again.\r\n\r\nLoving Ballyhack hasn’t always been easy for Lawrence, who in 2014 shared his displeasure of the track on social media after a few tough rounds in his first appearance at the course.\r\n\r\n“When I was 14, you know, I thought you hit driver on every hole, I thought you went at every flagstick, I thought you went at every putt. I was just dumb,” Lawrence said. “Honestly, this course has taught me a lot about how to play golf, and I feel like I get a little bit better every year that I come here and play. It’s about learning how to attack and approach a golf course instead of just bombing driver all day. And it’s honestly become one of my favorite golf courses.\r\n\r\n“It’s funny, I hit two drivers today. In 2014, I bet you I hit seven. I was just dumb. You can’t do that.”\r\n\r\nBecause of the tone set Thursday, the field’s only chance of rallying involved Lawrence backing up over the event’s next two days. With only two bogeys over the course of 54 holes, that opportunity never materialized.\r\n\r\n“He’s too good of a player not to win,” Young said. “He just has a different game than everybody else. He’s always played well here. For him to win, it’s really no surprise. He’s been very close. Now for him to finally get the win, my hat’s off to him.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nJohn O’Leary, PGA, of Trump National Golf Club in Potomac Falls, earned low professional honors with a three-day 209 and finished fourth overall. After struggling to a 74 on Thursday, a round that included a few “rough Ballyhack bounces,” he said, O’Leary switched putters for the final two rounds and returned 69 and 66 to finish a shot clear of Roanoke’s Michael Wade.\r\n\r\n“I really hit my irons decent, and that gave me some good looks,” O’Leary said of his Saturday 66. “I had a couple of key up and downs that really kept my round going.”\r\n\r\nNext up for O’Leary is a trip to the PGA Championship at Harding Park Aug. 6-9. He earned his way into the field by finishing in the top 20 of the 2019 PGA Player of the Year list. O’Leary will be one of 18 club professionals to compete in the event.\r\n\r\nWade and Forest amateur Marshall Tinsley (Winton Farm) finished tied for fifth at 210. Tinsley is the reigning VSGA Mid-Amateur champion.",

    "title": "Clutch putt gives Lukowicz the 115th Rhode Island Amateur",
    "teaser": "Jamie Lukowicz holds off the defending champion Andrew O'Leary at the 35th hole at Pawtucket Country Club",
    "articleText": "Every athlete dreams of coming through in the clutch when everything is on the line.\r\n\r\nA game-winning shot, a last-second touchdown. In golf, it is a putt to win a tournament.\r\n\r\nJamie Lukowicz stepped up to an 18-footer on hole No. 35 (par 4, 434 yards) the 17th at Pawtucket Country Club (par 69, 6,420 yards) to win the 115th Rhode Island Golf Association Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHe and his caddie Rob Grossguth, a 2003 Finalist, read the putt perfectly and he rolled it in the center. And when that putt reached the bottom of the cup, he put himself in his position to get the missing notch in his belt.\r\n\r\n“The putt was downhill, and I didn’t want to roll it four feet by,” said Lukowicz, 46, of Newport. “I knew exactly where I stood. I read it to break a little left to start and to the right at the end. It rolled it in dead center.”\r\n\r\nThe host club’s Andrew O’Leary still had a 15-footer to extend the match but was unable to respond. \r\n\r\nNo. 3 seed Lukowicz, aided by a brilliant tee-to-green game and a hot putter, claimed the 115th #RIAmateur at Pawtucket in Saturday’s 36-hole Final with a 2&1 victory over defending champion and No. 1 seed O’Leary.\r\n\r\nLukowicz hit his tee shot in the right trees on No. 35 and drew a break because he had a shot to the green. He said his 8-iron from 165 yards came out of the rough hot but held the green.\r\n\r\n“I had no desire to play hole No. 36 (No. 18) (par 4, 379 yards),” said Lukowicz. “It was a great feeling to win it on hole No. 35. Andrew is a great player and a great kid.”\r\n\r\n“That putt Jamie made to win was the story of the day,” said O’Leary, 20, of Norfolk, Mass. “Jamie made a lot of nice putts today and I didn’t.\r\n\r\n“I was hitting the ball well on the range and was loose. I hit the ball solid all day. I didn’t have much fear when hitting my approach shots. I left a few putts short or I just missed them. My speed on the greens is usually good. You aren’t going to putt well the whole week and I didn’t have it at the right time.”\r\n\r\nLukowicz, a Finalist in 2017 at Valley Country Club, said on Friday he needed to come out and make birdies to beat O’Leary.\r\n\r\nHe did just that.\r\n\r\nIn the morning 18, Lukowicz shot 67 to O’Leary’s 69. He made three birdies to O’Leary’s one.\r\n\r\nHe closed out that 67 in style on No. 18 with a 20-footer after O’Leary made a 30-footer for par. A huge momentum boost heading into the afternoon being 2-up instead of 1-up.\r\n\r\nAfter he and O’Leary each had two wins on Nos.19-23, he still stood 2-up. But then he made three consecutive birdies on Nos. 24 (No. 6) (par 4, 414 yards), 25 (No. 7) (par 3, 173 yards) and 26 (No. 8) (par 5, 542 yards). O’Leary birdied two of them, but it moved him to 3-up with 10 holes to play.\r\n\r\n“You don’t think about how many birdies you have made in a row,” said Lukowicz, of Agawam Hunt. “You are trying to make one after the other. I was trying to get up as many holes as I could.”\r\n\r\nThe shot of the day for Lukowicz came on hole No. 25. He nearly aced it with a 7-iron and his birdie was conceded. Putting him in firm control of the match with the sun beating down on the both of them and their energy draining hole-by-hole.\r\n\r\nHe then converted a pressure-packed 4-footer on No. 26 to halve in birdie. He raced his first putt a little by and had to clean up after reaching the par 5 in two.\r\n\r\n“In these types of situations, you tend to get a little quick and want to rush,” said Lukowicz. “But Rob [Grossguth] told me to be patient and I did that. It was good to be ahead in this match as opposed to having to come from behind against Billy [Forcier] in the 2017 Final.\r\n\r\nThey halved Nos. 26-30 in par and O’Leary won Nos. 32 (No. 14) (par 4, 414 yards) and 34 (No. 16) (par 4, 432 yards) with birdies and was knocking on the door until Lukowicz shut it with that 18-footer on No. 35.\r\n\r\nO’Leary had a chance to make history through a few different avenues. He was looking to become the 13th player in the history of the event to win at least two-consecutive titles. The last time was Brad Valois in 2006-07.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHe also was looking to win at his home club. The last player to do that was Mike Soucy at Metacomet Golf Club in 2001.\r\n\r\nBut what he’s done in his first two appearances in the #RIAmateur can’t be overlooked.\r\n\r\nHe was the qualifying medalist both years and won his first nine matches before falling to Lukowicz Saturday.\r\n\r\n“This run I have had in this tournament has been a lot of fun,” said O’Leary, a rising junior at the University of Notre Dame. “Especially playing that year at Shelter Harbor and this year at my home club. I was happy to play well the last two years and I hope I can continue to make a run in this tournament for years to come.”\r\n\r\nLukowicz has won RIGA majors before. He won the Stroke Play in 2018, the John Burke (Gross) in 2018 and the Mid-Amateur in 2014 and 2015. \r\n\r\nBut saying you are the Rhode Island Amateur champion has a different ring to it.\r\n\r\n“There’s so many great players in the history of this tournament that have won it,” said Lukowicz. “Hard work and practice pay off. I grind hard on my wedges and my putting. I hit a lot of balls.”\r\n\r\nHe played the 35 holes in 4 under, 33 of them were flawless.\r\n\r\n“Under the circumstances, this is the best golf I have ever played,” said Lukowicz. “I am proud of myself. I have come a long way.”",

    "articleText": "JT Pittman came through after sleeping on the lead Saturday to take the 92nd West Texas Amateur title back home to Monahans, Texas. \r\n\r\n“I really tried not to think about anybody else,” Pittman, a sophomore at Midland College, told the TGA following his final round 70. “I just tried to just play the golf course one shot at a time and make as many birdies as I could.”\r\n\r\nPittman executed the plan to near perfection as he made five birdies during his final round to post a two-under effort to win by two. In winning, he was the only player in the field to break par every round.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“A lot of great players have played against me this week, hats off to them, they all played great,” Pittman said. “But I am glad I got the win.”\r\n\r\nAmong those chasing Pittman on Sunday was San Angelo native Jansen Smith. The Texas Tech junior began the final round five shots back of Pittman. Tallying a 67, Jansen was a double-bogey and a bogey on 18 away from at least forcing a playoff against Pittman. Unable to stay mistake-free, Smith will settle for a runner-up finish at 210.\r\n\r\nClosing out the top-5 in the championship division were Michael Heidelbaugh (212), Robert Johnson (214), Collin Clark (214), and Bryce Waters (214).\r\n\r\nIn the senior division, former Texas Senior Amateur champion Lewis Stephenson came from seven shots back in the final round with a 66 to win by two shots.\r\n\r\nIn the super senior division, Doug Hopton-Jones successfully defended his 2019 West Texas Amateur title. It is his third West Texas Amateur win (2019, 2002).\r\n\r\nIt was a hot week in San Angelo, with temperatures in the mid-90s and only a little wind blowing across Bentwood Coutnry Club.",

    "articleText": "Loyola (Maryland) sophomore Carlo Pizzano held off McClure Thompson in a playoff to win the 2nd annual Savannah Quarters Invitational at The Club at Savannah Quarters in Pooler, Ga.\r\n\r\nThompson was trying to become the second \"McClure\" of the weekend to win a big tournament. McClure Meissner took home the Southern Amateur Championship at Maridoe in a playoff, but Thompson could not quite match the feat.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nSharing a one-shot overnight lead, Thompson and Pizzano were paired together in the final round. Thompson posted an opening 2-under 70 and a 6-under 66 while Pizzano opened with a 66 and followed it up with a 70 of his own.\r\n\r\nThe pair had an eventful final 18. Pizzano took an early lead but fell behind by two with a double-bogey and a bogey on holes No. 8 and 9. Thompson was up and down, with three birdies and three bogeys to turn at even-par 36. \r\n\r\nBoth players elevated their games on the back nine, with Pizzano going four under and Thompson three under to put Thompson one shot up on the 18th tee at 11 under.\r\n\r\nPerhaps feeling the pressure, Thompson came away with a bogey, and the two made their way back to the 18th tee, each having shot 2-under 70.\r\n\r\nBoth making pars on the first playoff hole (No. 18), Pizzano called 'game' on No. 1.\r\n\r\nPlaying aggressively, Pizzano nearly holed out from the fairway as his ball came to rest just inches from the pin. Thompson, needing a birdie to extend the match, could not do so, giving Pizzano the crown as the second winner of the SQI.\r\n\r\nAlex Locke (68) and Sam Sikes (70) shared third at 8 under, two shots out of the playoff.

    "articleText": "The 59th edition of the Jacksonville Amateur Championship, sponsored and conducted by the Jacksonville Area Golf Association (JAGA), gets underway Thursday at Jax Beach Golf Club in Jacksonville Beach. The 54-hole championship will crown its 2020 champion on Saturday.\r\n\r\nUniversity of North Florida assistant golf coach <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/12756/Jordan-Batchelor?p=1\">Jordan Batchelor</a> of San Jose Country Club will defend.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in the 59-year history of the Jacksonville Amateur female contestants will compete. The trio includes <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18164/Gabriela-Ruffels?p=1\">Gabriela Ruffels</a> of Melbourne, Australia, Tori Mouton of St. Johns, Fla. and Hannah Stevens of Jacksonville.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nRuffels is the reigning U.S. Women’s Amateur champion, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25400/Ruffels-takes-down-Valenzuela-in-grueling-U-S--Women-s-Am-final\">having claimed the prestigious USGA title</a> last August in Mississippi. The rising University of Southern California junior also <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25240/Aussie-showdown--Ruffels-tops-Choi-to-get-her-North-and-South-title\">claimed last summer’s North and South title</a> at Pinehurst Resort in North Carolina. “Gabi” is the daughter of former professional tennis players Ray and AnnaMaria Ruffels. Her older brother <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/12938/Ryan-Ruffels?p=1\">Ryan Ruffels</a> has status on the PGA TOUR’s Korn Ferry Tour.\r\n\r\n“In this day and age, with so much changing, maybe it should be more normal for women to play in tournaments that were all men,” said Ruffels to the Garry Smits of the Florida Times-Union. “Girls are hitting the ball farther and I think we’re under-estimated sometimes, especially in golf. We’ll see. I’m excited to go play there.”\r\n\r\nUSC assistant coach Katie Mitchell is confident that Ruffels will be comfortable playing the same tees as the men.\r\n\r\n“She plays a ton of golf with our men’s team and her brother and she’s very comfortable playing side-by-side with men,” said Mitchell to Smits. “She hits it a long way, hits her irons well and loves firm and fast courses. She won’t be intimidated at all.”\r\n\r\nMouton won the 2019 JAGA First Coast Women’s Amateur at Eagle Harbor Golf Club in Fleming Island. She will begin her junior year at The Bolles School in Jacksonville next month.\r\n\r\nStevens was awarded a JAGA scholarship last month and in August is bound for Flagler College in St. Augustine where she will play golf for the Saints. She is a regular at Jax Beach Golf Club.\r\n\r\nThe championship features 84 entries, 15 of which are in a category which accepts entries from outside JAGA’s Northeast Florida footprint. The 15 hail from all over the state of Florida, and Georgia and Illinois, plus Australia and Ecuador.\r\n\r\nThe field was increased from 78 to 84 last week due to significant demand and a growing alternates list and host Jax Beach Golf Club’s reputation as a faster-playing golf course.\r\n\r\nContestants range in age from 16 to 66.\r\n\r\nPast champions <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/1956/David-Anthony?p=1\">David Anthony</a> (2006) and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/1691/Duke-Butler-IV?p=1\">Duke Butler IV</a> (2009) will join Batchelor at Jax Beach, all in pursuit of their second Amateur title.\r\n\r\nThe North Florida Junior Golf Foundation will be represented via its two exemptions extended to Andrew Davis of Fleming Island, Fla. and Cody Carroll of Jacksonville who plays for Coach Scott Schroeder and Batchelor at UNF.\r\n\r\nHandicap index eligibility is limited to six. Fifty-one contestants are registered with handicap indexes of scratch (0) or plus-digits.\r\n\r\nThe contestants will face a par-71 layout of approximately 6,700 yards.\r\n\r\nThe first tee time all three days will be approximately 7:30. A cut will be made after 36 holes, with the top 39 and ties vying for the title on Saturday.",

    "articleText": "The Country Club of North Carolina is continuing the storied tradition of the National Father-Son Invitational, with the 51st installment of the event teeing off this week with Championship, Senior, and Super Senior flights.\r\n\r\n2012 U.S. Senior Open champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/49432/Douglas-Hanzel\">Doug Hanzel</a> and his son Drew, both from Savannah, Georgia are looking to defend their 2019 senior flight title.

The golf courses at CCNC are part of the experience. It’s really enjoyable because they are always in good shape. It’s a great test.”\r\n\r\nThe four-time AmateurGolf.com Senior Player of the Year and current <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-rankings/senior-men\">No. 2 ranked senior</a> is using the tournament as one of his final tune-ups before he heads out west to be a part of the 2020 U.S. Amateur at Bandon Dunes.\r\n\r\nThe Hanzels are among a list of notable names who have won the event since its inception in 1971. Tom and Tom Kite Jr.; Arthur and Scott Hoch; Rod and Steve Spittle; Kelly and Blair Miller have graced the trophy over the years.\r\n\r\n“My Dad passed away a few years ago but I still have the trophies in my study,” said the 1992 U.S. Open champion Kite. “They kind of look like water pitchers not like the trophies of today.”\r\n\r\nThis year’s event will not have just one but two former U.S Senior Amateur champions in the field. <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/33392/Paul-Simson\">Paul Simson</a>, a 29-time champion of Carolinas Golf Association events including two Carolinas Amateur titles, was a late addition to the field. In 2006 he won the North Carolina Senior Amateur, the added the British Senior Amateur and the North and South Senior title to his resume to vault to No. 2 rank in the US among Senior players. In 2010, Simson won the British Senior Amateur, Canadian Senior Amateur, and the US Senior Am in a span of 55 days.\r\n\r\nThe three-round event begins July 24 with teams playing best-ball Friday and Saturday. The final round will take place on July 26 when combined score will be the name of the game to help crown three new champions.\r\n\r\nRick and Connor Jones have won two of the last three National Father-Son Championships at CCNC.",

Each player must have his temperature taken and fill out a health questionnaire prior to each round.\r\n\r\nOther precautions include:\r\n\r\n- Players may not arrive earlier than 90 minutes before their scheduled tee time and are requested to leave as soon as possible after concluding a round.\r\n\r\n- No caddies will be permitted except for family members.\r\n\r\n- Masks are required indoors, and encouraged but not mandatory outdoors.\r\n\r\n“Parents and players are very appreciative of what’s being done,” said Yerger to Mike Mastovich of the Tribune-Democrat. “The protocols we have in place have been very successful. We’re really pleased. The players have assumed a lot of responsibility.”",

    "articleText": "It’s been said that the hardest thing to do in sports is to repeat as a champion, but Camden’s Cole Anderson dispelled that theory today at Biddeford-Saco CC, shooting a bogey-free 65 to win the Maine Amateur Championship for the second year in a row.\r\n\r\nThe 19-year old member from the Samoset Resort entered today’s final round with a three stroke lead over six players and didn’t make any mistakes en route to a six shot victory. Starting his round on Biddeford-Saco’s 10th hole today, Anderson parred the first two holes before making his first birdie on the par-5 12th. He added birdies on 17 and 18 to make the turn at 3-under par for the day. He added two more birdies at the 1st and 3rd to separate himself from the pack. The exclamation point came on the 9th hole when he drained a 15-foot birdie putt in front of the appreciative gallery.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHis rounds of 71-67-65—203 (-10) gave him the lowest score in relation to par in the history of this event. Anderson played the final 39 holes of the tournament without a single bogey, including two bogey-free rounds to finish the event. He posted three rounds in the 60s at Portland CC last year to win his first Amateur en route to another runaway victory. The rising sophomore at Florida State University is now -19 in his last six rounds of the Maine Amateur.\r\n\r\nDespite the play of Anderson, the rest of the field is not to be overlooked, as there was some great golf at Biddeford-Saco in the final round. John Hayes, the 2015 Maine Amateur champion, finished in second place after shooting a final round 68 with a three-day total of 209 (-4). Will Kannegieser finished in third place with a score of 210 (-3) after shooting 69 in his last two days. Caleb Manuel was fourth with 211 (-2), and Drew Powell rounded out the top five as the only other player under par for the tournament with 212 (-1).\r\n\r\nOther than Anderson’s 65, the low round of the day was shot by Bennett Berg of The Woodlands Club. The 16-year old rattled off a staggering nine birdies to shoot 66 and vault himself into a top ten finish despite an opening 79 on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nThe top 16 players earn an invitation into the 2020 Match Play Invitational at Spring Meadows GC in early August. Additionally, all players who made the cut earned a berth in next year’s Maine Amateur Championship at Kebo Valley GC.\r\n\r\n-- story courtesy Maine Golf Association",

    "articleText": "It’s often said that being around younger folks can keep you young at heart. For one Sunnehanna competitor, it also keeps his golf game young.\r\n\r\nOklahoma head coach Ryan Hybl holds a one-shot lead over one of the most elite fields on the road to the U.S. Amateur.\r\n\r\nHybl, who has been the Sooners head coach since 2009, posted a 5-under 65 at the opening round of the Sunnehanna Amateur on Tuesday.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“[I] putted the eyes out of it today,” Hybl told AmateurGolf.com following his round. “[I’m] very comfortable out here at Sunnehanna as this is one of my favorite places in the world for amateur golf.”\r\n\r\nHis comfort level paid off as the tournament saw two weather stoppages during the afternoon, forcing some groups to finish their first-round Wednesday morning. With three birdies on the front nine, Hybl found comfort in the course as he has over the years. Carding an eagle on the par-5 11th, Hybl was able to negate two bogeys he had on the backside to go along with back-to-back birdies on holes 15 and 16.\r\n\r\nHybl knocked off the dust last week at the Southern Amateur at Maridoe. Missing the cut (+9), Hybl was just happy to get back to tournament golf after a six-year hiatus.\r\n\r\nLSU’s Trey Winstead and Notre Dame’s Palmer Jackson will be a part of a handful of groups looking to complete the last few holes of their first rounds Wednesday morning. Through 16 holes, the pair sit at 4-under, just one back of Hybl.\r\n\r\nCole Hammer tallied a 3-under opening round, seemingly putting Saturday’s debacle at the Southern Amateur behind him. The Longhorn is in a four-way tie for fourth.\r\n\r\nOne of Hybl’s pupils Quade Cummins, who is coming off a third-place finish at the Southern Amateur, carded a 1-over 71 and is in the thick of things as round two commences.",

Prestwick Golf Club played tough but fair as 25 participants posted even-par or better. 19 golfers are still within 6-shots of the leaders, but the main priority is to make the top 32 players who will advance to match play after 36 holes.\r\n\r\nCo-leader Marissa Wenzler had the cleanest scorecard of the four who lead. Her bogey-free 69 saw birdies on hole Nos. 4, 5, and 15 to accompany 15 pars on her round. Fellow co-leader Mary Parsons, on the other hand, had the most colorful round among the leaders.\r\n\r\nParsons began her day with a bogey on No. 1 before immediately gaining the stroke back with a birdie on No. 2. Going out in 34 (2-under), Parsons took a ride on a 4-hole roller coaster. Flip-flopping birdies and bogeys on holes 10-12, Parsons leveled out the rest of the way with a birdie on No. 17 to give her a share of the overnight lead.",

Phil Murphy on Tuesday added the golfer's home state of Virginia onto a list of 31 states that require a 14-day quarantine due to the coronavirus pandemic.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nGolfers making the cut to Wednesday's final round are required to withdraw if in the past two weeks they have visited states added to the list: Alaska, Delaware, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Virginia, and Washington.\r\n\r\n\"A very difficult decision for us to make, but the decision already has been made,\" Kevin Purcell, executive director of the New Jersey State Golf Association, said late Tuesday afternoon. \"The policy was in place, and there's already been people who have withdrawn from the event because they had played in the states that had been on the list at that time.\"\r\n\r\nHall, a pro at Upper Montclair, shot 5-under-par 67 during Tuesday's second round at Knickerbocker Country Club and stood at 7-under 137. Muehr, who plays out of Pine Valley and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25650/Michael-Muehr-wins-his-third-Crump-Cup-title\">won his third Crump Cup title there last fall</a>, shot a second consecutive 69 and was one shot back at 138.\r\n\r\nMuehr, a former pro, and last year's State Open runner-up was notified via phone of the withdrawal a couple of hours after completing his round.\r\n\r\n\"The timing was bad,\" Muehr told AmateurGolf.com. \"If it happened a day later, I'm good.\r\n\r\n\"I totally acknowledge and respect that [the NJGA's decision]. It was an easy decision. I wasn't going to fight it.\"\r\n\r\nHall will shoot for his third State Open title. Hall, 38, won in 2015 and 2016 and was runner-up in 2018. He holds a one-shot lead over amateur Mark Costanza of Hamilton Farm, who shot a tournament-best 65 for 138. They will tee off in Wednesday's final twosome at 8:40 a.m.\r\n\r\n“Fortunately, I’ve been in this spot a few times,” Hall said a couple of hours before news of Muehr's withdrawal. “so I kind of know how to handle it.”\r\n\r\nIn his first event back since September, Muehr had an interesting scorecard – how many golfers have more eagles than birdies? He had two eagles, one birdie and two bogeys for his second consecutive 69. He eagled the par-5 10th and the par-5 18th, closing by sinking a downhill 20-footer.\r\n\r\nMuehr made the tournament officials DQ him rather than withdrawing, saying \"I did make sure I let them know 'You guys have to DQ me. I'm not WD'ing'.'\" \r\n\r\nMuehr's disqualification was reminiscent of what happened to Ben James of Connecticut, who earlier this month was unable to defend his state junior title after <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26164/COVID-19-quarantine-keeps-James-from-defending-state-junior-title\">being forced to withdraw</a> by a similar COVID-19 quarantine.",

    "articleText": "The Georgia Women's Amateur Championship came to a thrilling conclusion on Tuesday with Sara Im of Duluth taking home the trophy following a seven-hole playoff.\r\n\r\nThe 91st playing of the championship was conducted by the Georgia Women's Golf Association and the Georgia State Golf Association at The Landings Club in Savannah on the Oakridge Course.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nIm (74-72-73) fell back early in the round with two bogeys through the first five holes, but played steady throughout the rest of the day and led by one stroke going into the par-4 18th over Thienna Huynh of Lilburn (76-68-75) and Mary Miller of Savannah (69-75-76). Im made par, but Huynh came up clutch by rolling in her birdie putt to force a three-hole aggregate playoff.\r\n\r\nStarting on the par-3 16th, Im took the early advantage over Huynh with a par, but a bogey on the par-4 17th had the duo tied going into the final hole. Both players made par on the 18th hole forcing a sudden death playoff to determine the winner.\r\n\r\nPars were matched on the next two playoff holes before Im knocked in her birdie attempt on the par-3 3rd hole on the Oakridge Course. Huynh answered right back with a birdie of her own to extend the playoff to a seventh hole.\r\n\r\nThat is where it ended as Im converted another birdie attempt to capture the trophy and become the 91st Georgia Women's Amateur champion.",

    "articleText": "The name \"<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-courses/TX/Carrollton/34492/Maridoe-Golf-Club\">Maridoe</a>\" is quickly becoming familiar to golfers across all levels of championship golf. The golf club in Carrollton, Texas, is the brainchild of its billionaire oil tycoon owner Albert Huddleston, and has quickly emerged as a go-to host of important golf tournaments at all levels.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn 2018-19, Maridoe played host to three Texas state championships. The <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/8686/Maridoe-Collegiate-Invitational\">Maridoe Intercollegiate</a> was created in 2018 to host top college players. Then came it's first amateur major, the 2019 Trans-Mississippi Championship.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis year, as the COVID-19 pandemic all but shut down competitive golf at all levels, Maridoe was where professional golf made its return, with the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/9294/Maridoe-Samaritan-Fund-Invitational\">Maridoe Samiraitan Fund Invitational</a> (MSFI) and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/9312/Maridoe-Samaritan-Fund-Invitational-II\">MSFI II</a> drawing top pros and amateurs to raise money for out-of-work caddies among others.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nNext came the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/9335/Maridoe-Junior-Invitational\">Maridoe Junior</a>, one of the earliest national-level junior events to be played as golf emerged from the lockdown.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMost recently, the club played host to the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/1869/Southern-Amateur-Championship\">Southern Amateur</a>, another amateur major and one of the four events selected by the USGA to comprise the Road to the U.S. Amateur at Bandon Dunes, with the winner and runner-up <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26152/USGA-to-exempt-winners--runners-up-of-4-AM-majors-into-the-US-AM\">receiving exemptions</a> into the national championship.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThere is plenty more to come. The inaugural <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/9242/East-West-Matches\">East-West Matches</a>, a Ryder Cup style team event for American mid-amateurs and seniors, is scheduled for November. And in 2021 Maridoe will host its first USGA championship, the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/7038/U-S--Women-s-Amateur-Four-Ball-Championship\">U.S. Women's Four-Ball</a>.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062218.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\nAmateurGolf.com writer Brayden Conover got the opportunity to sit down with Huddleston to discuss what the club means to him and what its plans are for its future.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Q: How did Maridoe come about?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nA: I was fortunate to be raised in a golf family in Eastern Tennessee and my father was quite a great player. So all my life I was around great play and I’d carry double staff bags at <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-courses/TN/Alcoa/26420/Green-Meadow-Country-Club\">Green Meadow Country Club</a> in Maryville, Tennessee at five dollars a bag. Everything was golf-centric for us. My father when I was 13, with two friends, built a golf course called <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-courses/TN/Knoxville/26407/Fox-Den-Country-Club\">Fox Den</a> in Knoxville, Tennessee to have a place for his friends. I thought that was one of the greatest things I’d ever experienced.<br><br>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, my father had cancer at a young age and died, but I always said at some point in time if I have the resources and the opportunity I would like very much to be responsible for creating a Walt Disney sandbox for golf for your friends. So I tried for 20 years to find the right place to do it and every time I tried to buy something it wasn’t for sale or I didn’t get there in time. But the good Lord had something better for me which was this property.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn January of 2014, I was able to purchase it right in the middle of Dallas, Texas. Largest private lake in Dallas County. Water is a big thing in Texas. So a good friend of mine, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/7365/Steve-Smyers?p=1\">Steve Smyers</a> -- I’ve always admired him for what he had done at <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-courses/IN/Zionsville/5584/Wolf-Run-Golf-Club\">Wolf Run</a> in Zionsville, Indiana. I wanted an architect that would allow me to be collaborative. The idea was to create a championship golf course on which regardless of your handicap, you’d have a good time if you put your ego in the right place. So I call him up about working with me on this. I wanted to be able to share my ideas because when I was in second grade I was creating fantasy golf holes. Everyone at some point likes to act on their fantasies. That’s what Maridoe represents to me personally.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062219.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Q: What was your thought process behind the MSFI’s?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nA: I was out here and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/19912/Martin-Flores?p=1\">Martin Flores</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/8190/Jordan-Spieth?p=1\">Jordan Spieth</a> had just finished playing. I saw them and said ‘hey guys, how y’all doing? By the way, is this the longest you’ve ever gone without playing in a tournament?’ and one of them said ‘Well gosh, yeah since I was six years old.’ Well, I thought that was kind of silly so I came back in and told Alison Morrison (the managing member at Maridoe) ‘We need to have a tournament. It’s not right that these sharp blades aren’t out here practicing and playing.’ The COVID protocol is something that can be very very seriously adhered to and taken very seriously. Golf is one of the few sports if any in which the protocol necessary for safety can be accomplished. So we said ‘let’s just do it’. <br><br>\r\n\r\nWe were just going to do it for our own people and then we decided to have the Maridoe Samaritan Fund and have people pay a little bit of an entry fee [to benefit] the caddies and some of the people that have physical problems. It spread like wildfire so all the people began talking to other people and they’re all very hungry to play. When <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/14160/Viktor-Hovland?p=1\">Viktor [Hovland]</a> was on his way back to Oklahoma, he told Alison ‘let’s do it again’. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nSo literally within 24-hours of finishing Samaritan 1.0, we [plan] 2.0. We again adhered to all the protocols. The first time we had spacers and you couldn’t touch the pins. The second time we got a little more lenient. <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/14761/Brandon-Wu?p=1\">Brandon Wu</a> went 3-under on the last five holes to win that tournament.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThen the juniors say ‘Hey Mr. Huddleston, we have nowhere to play. Can you do something for us?’ and I’m a big proponent of junior golf so I said ‘Why not?’ so we created the Maridoe Junior Invitational.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWe did not do it to get any notoriety. We did it because we felt it was the right thing to do and we could do it… It goes to show you that if you just do the right thing, good things come out of doing the right thing for the right reasons.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062220.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Q: What kind of player does Maridoe favor?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nA: Maridoe was designed to identify a player that can fly the ball and work the ball, rather than the mono-dimensional players being created that swing it as hard as they can and launch it straight up in the air. You can’t make a course too long for them so you want to make a course that is strategically interesting and if you can’t flight the ball, if you can’t dead-hands the ball, you can’t work the ball, then you’ll come up on the short end.<br><br>\r\n\r\nI always tell people that if you take a great player that’s mono-dimensional and can only hit it hard and high and you take a great player that can flight the ball, work the ball, that individual will own the other person’s car, house, mom’s house, their shoes because every hole on purpose changes orientation. You have to reset your subconscious on how you’re strategically going to attack the golf hole. If you leave your brain in the parking lot, you have no chance whatsoever. For people that have a sharp blade in golf, I wanted to make a place that would make a sharp blade sharper. When you leave this property you’re not intimidated.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062221.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Q: What is the future of Maridoe?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nA: Maridoe is created to host anything that is attractive in golf. What I didn’t want to have happen is if someone said ‘You could host a certain tournament and we’d love to have it there, but had you this…’ I did not want that to be the case so I wanted to create a golf course in which there is no reason you couldn’t host anything here, of any level of competition. The golf course in itself is so flexible. There are so many tees, and the wind changes, and you can push and pull the golf course.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMy view is I like short par threes which you have here. Everyone’s going for length and you can’t out-length these guys and also you cut off three-fourths of most of the people playing by just doing that (over-lengthening the golf course). Maridoe has a mixture of short/long holes; you can push and pull it. My favorite thing about Maridoe, and it was done purposefully: I want a great player to periodically be terribly uncomfortable because there’s an awkward shot ahead of them. And also, the second shots on par fives traditionally are mindless layups, but not here. The drive is not that hard, but the second-shots are typically awkward. Awkward breeds indecision and indecision will breed mistakes.<br><br>\r\n\r\nI also consider the great young players. I want them to inadvertently use what I would call ‘excessive greed’ to bury themselves. The buffalo grass rough, although not very long, generates tremendous flier lies. You’re never comfortable and confident in how far the ball may go, again creating awkwardness, indecision, uncertainty. I think that separates the best in all categories.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt really separates the richest cream from cream, the ones who can think their way around the course. If you get out of position don’t be a hero. We bury heroes here. No headstones, but they’re out there. It’s not a mindless game at Maridoe.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMy view is very simple. You’re supposed to have fun. I think Maridoe is very demanding but fair.",

Golf Association.\r\n\r\n“It really shows that I’m at that level now,\" he continued. \" I really improved so much in the last year. At the start of the year, I wasn’t really playing my best.

The course is located in the same town where the \"shot heard round the world\" was fired to start the Revolutionary War in 1775. The club's first nine holes designed by Ross opened for play in 1913, while the club itself dates back to 1895. Mature trees, and fescue-lined fairways give the course a distinctive look, while typically difficult Donald Ross greens make for some interesting pin placements and diabolical putts.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe New England Amateur winner gets their name on the Harry B. McCracken Jr. trophy, and this is the first time the tournament has been played since the legendary golf administrator passed in 2019. For 50 years – more than half of his adult life – the Massachusetts native was a dedicated volunteer to the Massachusetts Golf Association, New England Golf Association and the USGA. McCracken, the 2007 recipient of the USGA’s Joe Dey Award for meritorious service to the game, was a fixture for years at the New England Amateur.",

    "articleText": "Three shot swings can happen in an instant.\r\n\r\nGeorgia Tech’s Connor Howe had to wait for more than an instant for his play to come to fruition at the 91st Southeastern Amateur.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nPaired with the overnight leader and low-man of the tournament Will Chandler (Georgia), and round one co-leader Bryce Lewis (Tennessee) in the final round, Howe needed an eagle and two birdies to claim the title on Thursday.\r\n\r\nBeginning the day three shots back of Chandler, Howe played a clean front-nine. Carding an eagle on the par-5 4th, the Yellowjacket made the turn at 2-under on the day and one shot back of Chandler.\r\n\r\nOn the par-4 11th, disaster struck for Chandler as he scraped a double-bogey to give Howe a one-shot lead. Chandler limped into the clubhouse with a 3-over 73, good for a fourth-place finish. \r\n\r\nWith the penultimate group of Alex Goff (Kentucky), Colin Bowles (Georgia Southern), and Nicholas Infanti (North Florida) beginning the day either tied with or one-shot back of Howe kept his blinders on. Goff was the only one making a charge from the second-to-last group as he posted a final-round 3-under 67 to take the clubhouse lead at 10-under\r\n\r\nHowe, who birdied the par-3 13th, bogeyed No. 17 following a brief weather delay to fall into a tie for the lead with Goff. \r\n\r\n\"To be honest I didn't know he [Goff] had birdied,\" Howe told AmateurGolf.com. \"I looked and he was still at nine-under with one to go so I was like 'Okay, par would win it.' But when I got up to the green I just forgot to look at the scoreboard and was planning on getting up-and-down to win.\"\r\n\r\nNeeding a birdie on No. 18 to avoid a playoff, Howe stepped up to the plate, draining a walk-off birdie chip for the championship win.\r\n\r\n\"It gives me a lot of confidence,\" Howe said. \"I'm just happy to be playing well.\"",

    "articleText": "Preston Summerhays emerged from a pack of four players tied after 36 holes to take a naroow lead into the final round of Sunnehanna Amateur.\r\n\r\nSummerhays, an Arizona State signee, posted a 4-under 66 to vault himself into a solo lead with one round remaining. Getting off to a hot start, Summerhays carded three birdies on his first four holes before making a bogey on the par-3 fifth. Following the bogey with four-straight pars to close out the front side, Summerhays went out in 33.\r\n\r\nTallying two birdies on the back nine, Summerhays finds himself sleeping on a slim one-shot margin. \r\n\r\n“I’m just going to keep on playing the way I have been playing,” Summerhays, who broke loose from a four-way tie for the lead through two rounds, told the Tribune-Democrat. “I’m going to attack when I have good numbers with wedges. I’m going to keep practicing my putting and make sure I make those 4 to 8-footers.”\r\n\r\nFirst round leader, Oklahoma coach Ryan Hybl, was unable to keep up with the younger players today. Hybl, 38,  got off on the wrong foot, opening his third round with a 4-over 39. Finding a way to save his round, he carded two birdies on the back nine for a 72 which places him into a tie for 15th at 3-under.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nFellow Sooner and day two co-leader Quade Cummins matched his head coach’s score with his own 72 to also slide from the lead.\r\n\r\nThe last of the four day two co-leaders, Auburn’s Graysen Huff finds himself in prime position to strike during the final round. Following his Wednesday 65 with a 3-under 67 on Thursday, Huff sits just one back of Summerhays.\r\n\r\nJoining Huff in second place is Southern Cal’s, Leon D’Souza. Catching fire in the middle part of his round, D’Souza went 5-under over a five-hole stretch (No. 8-12) which included an eagle on the par-5 11th.\r\n\r\nD’Souza made an eagle on the par-5 No. 11 and had birdies on 8, 9, 12 and 17. He made bogey on 14. He told the Tribune-Democrat in a post round interview that it was a long putt for birdie that really got him going.\r\n\r\n“Definitely the birdie on No. 8, that was 42 feet,” D’Souza said of the hole that helped spark his round. “I had made seven pars in a row until that. That pushed me in the right direction. I made an eagle on 11 and birdied 12.\"\r\n\r\nTrey Winstead sits in solo fourth at 7-under, three competitors are tied for fifth at 5-under. The final group of Summerhays, Huff, and D’Souza tee off at 9:30 am ET.",

    "articleText": "After winning his first five matches on his own, Jamie Voegeli got some help from who should’ve been his opponent in the championship match.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nVoegeli’s good friend Tyler Hunt was on the other side of the bracket and blew a 1 up lead on the 18th hole in the semifinal match. Losing the first playoff hole, Hunt gave way to Norman, Oklahoma native Charlie Jackson.\r\n\r\nHopping into Voegeli’s cart, the duo navigated their way through the Patriot Golf Club, gaining a 3 up advantage through just seven holes.\r\n\r\n“Tyler really is the reason I’m here,” Voegeli told Golf Oklahoma. “He got me started playing again.”\r\n\r\nAlthough down three early, Jackson fought back. Getting it back down to a one-hole lead, Jackson could not stop the putting clinic Voegeli was putting on.\r\n\r\nBeing 2 up with just five holes left, Voegeli’s marathon of two rounds a day for three days finally began to wear on him. Walking off the 13th green, Voegeli told Hunt how tired he was.\r\n\r\n“He [Hunt] told me I wasn’t tired and just needed to make one good swing,” remarked Voegeli.\r\n\r\nHe made more than just one good swing. With 270 yards into the par-5 15th, Voegeli and Hunt ran through their options. Instead of laying up, the duo decided to trust a 20-year-old 3 wood, a club that is older than Voegeli’s opponent who is heading to Abilene Christian next month. Executing the shot to near perfection, Voegeli cleaned up a two-putt for birdie and extended his lead to 3 up with three to go.\r\n\r\n After Jackson delayed his win on 16, Voegeli took the crown on 17 with a birdie to win 3&1.\r\n\r\n“I certainly didn’t expect to win this, but I’ve been playing really well leading up to it and I thought if I just stick to my game plan and execute one shot at a time, I would have a chance to beat anybody,” Voegeli said. “It sounds cliché, but that’s the mindset I had in all six matches.\r\n\r\n“I’m really grateful to Tyler for jumping in and helping me out. I know he was disappointed not to be in the finals. He’s a great friend and really the reason I’m playing golf today.”\r\n\r\nVoegeli is now one for one in Oklahoma’s top amateur event, having never played in it before.",

With that win, he became the third junior golfer to be awarded an exemption to the U.S. Open - so he has that to look forward to in the fall.\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25243/Summerhays-hits--shot-of-a-lifetime--on-way-to-U-S--Junior-win\">Summerhays hits 'shot of a lifetime' on way to U.S. Junior win</a>\r\n\r\nBut in the meantime, there is plenty of learning and growing to do on the golf course, and Summerhays proved that he's capable of winning a major four-round medal play tournament against a field stock full of Division I golfers.\r\n\r\n\"Last year after the U.S. Junior, I made some new goals,\" Summerhays told AmateurGolf.com \"I played really well on the high junior level but I thought a new goal would be to win a big amateur event, something slightly more challenging.\"\r\n\r\nAnd despite the fact that the Arizona State signee didn't <i>need</i> an exemption into the U.S. Amateur at Bandon Dunes this fall, his performance today, and all week, proves Summerhays is one of the players to watch a month from now at Bandon Dunes.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThursday, Summerhays posted a 4-under 66 to vault himself into a solo lead. But the Sunnehanna has one of the top fields in all of amateur golf, and there was no room to do anything but keep charging. \r\n\r\n“I’m just going to keep on playing the way I have been playing,” told the Tribune-Democrat after yesterday's round. “I’m going to attack when I have good numbers with wedges. I’m going to keep practicing my putting and make sure I make those 4 to 8-footers.”\r\n\r\nThe result? A nearly flawless round of 65 at Sunnehanna Country Club with just a single bogey on the fifth hole. His birdie on No. 18 to close out the win is shown below.\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Preston Summerhays birdies No. 18 to win <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SunnehannaAm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SunnehannaAm</a> at a record-tying 14-under <a href=\"https://t.co/M4Tscs8bxZ\">pic.twitter.com/M4Tscs8bxZ</a></p>— Michael Mastovich (@masty81) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/masty81/status/1286739587931439104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 24, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\nSummerhays loved the back nine all week -- posting 33, 32, and 33, but today's 4-under 31 was his best close of the week, and it provided him a three-shot cushion over a charging <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/19009/Travis-Vick?p=1\">Travis Vick</a>.\r\n\r\nThe University of Texas star started the day a full five shots behind Summerhays, but he caught fire today. \r\n\r\nAfter posting 3-under 32 on the front nine, he made the turn and eagled No. 10, then caught three-straight birdies on Nos. 15-17 to move to 8-under on the round, and 12-under on the tournament. A bogey at the last cost Vick the chance to set the bar one shot lower for Summerhays, still on the course, and playing in the final group at 12-under with two holes to play.\r\n\r\n\"I was definitely following it,\" Summerhays said. \"The last leaderboard I saw was on number 12. I think at that point I had a two-shot lead.\"\r\n\r\nBirdies on both of those final holes made it a moot point and Vick could rest knowing that his 63, and a solo second-place finish, was as good finish-wise as a 62 would have been. And if you're wondering what the record is, that's a 61 posted by <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/1933/Zack-Sucher?p=1\">Zack Sucher</a> in 2008. \r\n\r\n\"Because he [Vick] had such a good day, I thought I'd have to birdie at least one of the last two to either win or get into a playoff, so I stayed aggressive on those holes and made some good birdies.\"\r\n\r\nAs for Summerhays, his four rounds in the 60s and birdie-birdie finish are two things he's going to remember for a long time. \r\n\r\nWith the win, Summerhays tied one record and broke another.\r\n\r\nAt just 18 years and 2 days old, he is the youngest winner in tournament history, a title previously held by <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/693/Rickie-Fowler?p=1\">Rickie Fowler</a>, the 2008 champion. And with a tournament total of 14-under, he tied the previous scoring mark held by Allen Doyle.\r\n\r\nThe name Summerhays is legendary in Utah golf -- Preston's teacher (and father) is Boyd Summerhays, who also has Tony Finau under his wing, and is currently caddying for him at the 3M Open on the PGA Tour, where they are contending. To quote Boyd's website:\r\n\r\n\"Golf is in my blood. My grandfather, Pres Summerhays, was the head golf coach at the University of Utah. My father, Lynn, played collegiate golf, and for several years served as President of the Utah Junior Golf Association and on the USGA Committee. My uncle, Bruce Summerhays, is a Champions Tour winner and was also an accomplished golf instructor. His daughter, Carrie, is a former LPGA Tour player. My younger brother, Daniel, has played over 8 seasons on the PGA Tour, reaching as high as 53rd in the world rankings.\"\r\n\r\nWe'll have what they're having.\r\n\r\nLSU star <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22197/Trey-Winstead?p=1\">Trey Winstead</a> finished solo third at 10-under, while <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/17104/Quade-Cummins?p=1\">Quade Cummins</a> (Oklahoma), <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22106/Connor-Schmidt?p=1\">Connor Schmidt</a> (Drexel), and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/15454/Brandon-Mancheno?p=1\">Brandon Mancheno</a> (Auburn) posted 9-under to tie for fourth.

With the win, Gilkison becomes the third Kent State player in the last six years, joining Chase Johnson and Ian Holt.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062205.jpg\"><br>Josh Gilkison (L) and Brendan O'Reilly (Northern Amateur photo)<br><br></div></div><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe defending champion, Mitch Davis of the University of Indiana, finished in a tie for third at 8 under par with Nate Vontz of Creighton University and Timothy Lim of Drake Unviersity.<br><br>\r\n\r\nGilkison showed good form coming into the event, coming off of a 9th place finish in the Ohio Amateur.",

    "articleText": "The 20-year old Cal State Fullerton golfer Sara Camarena kept Katherine Zhu just out of arm's reach with a clutch par on the par-3 18th to win the 54th California Women's Amateur at Pasatiempo Golf Club.\r\n\r\nThe first foreign-born player to win the event, the Mexico City native was also playing in her first non-collegiate event in the state, after transferring to Fullerton from Oklahoma State in the spring. With COVID-19 shutting the season down, Camarena got to play just one event as a Titan.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nTwo holes up with two holes to play, Camarena jeopardized her lead with a triple-bogey on the 17th. In medal play, that kind of score could be disastrous. But in match play, a lead can only be whittled down one hole at a time.\r\n\r\nCamarena, once she saw her opponent tee off on the rare finishing par-3, knew what she had to do. Make sure to hit the green, and force your opponent to hole a birdie putt to extend the match. \r\n\r\n“On the tee on 18, I knew I was still 1-up. She (Zhu) hit a nice shot [to about 9 feet]. I just wanted to be on the safe side,” said Camarena.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes the subconscious mind knows where the pin is, and the body reacts.\r\n\r\nHer choked-up 8-iron off the tee of the on the downhill, 145-yard par 3 headed towards the tucked front-right hole location never left the flag.\r\n\r\n“I wanted to hit a draw but my ball actually just went straight,\" she explained. \"It worked out.”\r\n\r\nWhen Zhu missed her birdie putt, the rest was a formality; even though Camarena missed the birdie putt she wasn't taking any chances on the speedy greens, where even three footers can get away from you.\r\n\r\nHaving never seen Pasatiempo prior to the tournament, Camarena is a big fan of the Alister MacKenzie layout -- one that is open for the public to enjoy.\r\n\r\n“I learned where to hit and where to miss it,” Camarena said. “A big thing for me all week I think was my focus. I would try to relax in between shots. It’s hard to focus the whole time.”",

    "title": "California Amateur at Torrey Pines: Preview, LIVE SCORING",
    "teaser": "One of the oldest state championships tees off Monday at Torrey Pines. We take a look at both courses, and much more",
    "articleText": "The 109th playing of the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/1338/California-Amateur-Championship\">California Amateur Championship</a>, which is set to begin Monday, is important on a number of levels.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFor starters, back in March and April, with golf in much of the state closed down -- the host course was closed from mid-March to May 1 -- many of us wondered if there would even be a tournament this year. And then there's the iconic venue hosting for the first time. Torrey Pines is the host of an annual PGA Tour event, the 2008 U.S. Open, and the IMG Junior Worlds. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd if that isn't enough, consider the excitement of having the \"state am\" at Torrey Pines, just a year prior to the venue hosting its second U.S. Open.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nSo many future stars have been crowned at Torrey Pines during their amateur days that the list reads like a golf history book. If you can win at Torrey Pines, your game will travel.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNone of them dominated the cliffside fairways of the famous South Course at Torrey Pines like Tiger Woods. Counting the younger age brackets, Woods took home six Junior World titles, before winning his first 15-17 age bracket as a fifteen year old, hitting it 50 yards by the older players. He went on to amass eight PGA Tour Farmers Insurance Open titles. And then there was 2008, when he gritted his teeth in pain on a broken knee, and still won the U.S. Open in a playoff over Rocco Mediate.<br><br> \r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px; text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062229.jpg\"><br>2019 champion William Mouw<br>with the Edward B. Tufts trophy</div></div>One can only wonder if Woods would have had his name etched onto the amazing trophy if the California Amateur was held at Torrey Pines. (For the record, Ed Cuff famously beat Woods in the semi-finals in 1994, ending his best run at the title.)<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe California Amateur was originally held at Del Monte GC but shifted to Pebble Beach Golf Links when it was built in 1919. The championship remained at Pebble Beach through 2006, with the exception of 2000 when it was played at Bayonet and Blackhorse GCs due to the U.S. Open. (Remember Tiger's 15-shot victory?) That was also the time and place that a little golf website named <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/\">AmateurGolf.com</a> launched with a gorilla marketing campaign during the Open.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe California Amateur starts with 156 players playing two rounds of stroke play on July 27 and 28 on both the South and North courses at Torrey Pines. A field of 32 golfers who qualify for the match play portion will compete for that title on the South course, from July 29 to August 1.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<B>NORTH COURSE PREVIEW</B><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-courses/CA/La-Jolla/18129/Torrey-Pines-Golf-Club-North-Course\">North Course</a> went from good to great, after a multi-million dollar renovation and remodel under the direction of Tom Weiskopf opened in late 2016, in time for the 2017 Farmers.  <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe nines were reversed, and the par of hole Nos. 17 and 18 (old 8 and 9) changed from finishing 4-5 to finishing 5-4. Weiskopf's argument in making the change is that all of the most scenic oceanfront holes were formerly on the front nine, and he was right. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBeyond adding some length (particularly with some new back tees aimed at Tour players) the biggest change is the overall condition (it plays firmer now) and particularly the green complexes. If you haven't played there since the renovation you'll notice the turf reduction in the form of sandy areas with tufts of grass - they are definitely worth staying out of but most of the time you will be able to recover fine as long as you have a stance and swing.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062250.jpg\"><br>The tee shot on the par-3 15th on the North</div><br>\r\n\r\nThe greens (all with installed \"SubAir\" systems beneath) are fast, firm, and some of them bigger. The aforementioned par-5, No. 17 is now a really good risk/reward hole with the green standing right up against a barranca, Long hitters will have no trouble reaching the green and taking advantage, but it is a daunting shot from farther out.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOn the front nine, the 7th hole can be set up as a reachable par-4 but its green is probably the most controversial of Weiskopf's putting surfaces. A swale as big as a bath tub can send slightly missed shots on the right down a collection area into the rough. But for such an easy hole, it's really not unfair. Besides, when you pitch up to the green from the right side of the fairway -- or from the right rough where many tee balls wind up -- you'll see some creative pitch shot options using a backboard behind the green. It's a fun hole but because the hole isn't part of match play I'm guessing they won't use the forward tee this week. <br><br>\r\n\r\nOverall, the North is going to play easier than the South, as you typically see in the Farmers. But it's no pushover.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-course-reviews/3816/Torrey-Pines-South-Course-Review\">Open for Play: Torrey Pines North Course Review</a><br><br>\r\n\r\n<B>SOUTH COURSE PREVIEW</B><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-courses/CA/La-Jolla/1615/Torrey-Pines-Golf-Club-South-Course\">South Course</a> opens with a firm handshake -- if it was a Covid knuckle-bump your hand would be sore for a few holes. Bunkers left and right off the tee in the landing zone set the tone for much of the round since \"Open Doctor\" Rees Jones redesigned Torrey South -- it's not lost balls or deep rough that causes the most problems off the tee on the South, it's the diabolically positioned fairway bunkers. (Hit 10 of 14 fairways on the South and you've done well.) But the second shot, into the prevailing ocean breeze to a narrow, well-protected green, will really grab your attention. <br><br>\r\n\r\nAgain, the first hole tells you everything you need to know about approach shots into the greens at Torrey Pines South. You know some courses where hitting a drawing 7-iron into a green, maybe missing your target by a few feet and bouncing off the edge of a bunker winds up giving you a five foot putt for birdie? Not so at Torrey South. Balls that miss the mark routinely get rejected like NBA jump shots. And while many of the greenside bunkers are fairly manageable, some -- like the cavern on the right of No. 7, or the church pew bunkers on the par-5 13th, are really penal.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMy favorite hole is No. 4, pictured above. It's a lengthy par-4 guarded by bunkers on the right off the tee, and with just a seemingly tiny patch of rough separating the fairway from the cliff edge. The water isn't in <i>play</i> so much as it's just there in all it's resplendent glory. The play into the green for longer shots is to use the hill on the right, avoiding the small bunker and collection area in front of the green. The little bunker and collection area were a nice change from the previous design, a huge bunker surrounded by patchy rough. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIf one, two, and three didn't capture your attention, No. 4 most certainly did. For the rest of the day, par on any hole will be a good score -- for the long hitters in the field this week, it will be the par-5 holes (Nos. 6, 9, 13, and 18) where you can do the scoring.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAmong the par-4s, No. 12 stands out as one of the toughest perennially on the PGA Tour. Tees that stretch the hole back to over 500 yards and a deep, back-to-font sloping green (with the pacific ocean as a backdrop) demand 100% attention for all 17 minutes you play No. 12, but you can at least take a moment to watch hang gliders taking off from the nearby glider port defy gravity.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStarting with the tough par-3 11th, the back nine never lets up. The tee shot on No. 17 is particularly daunting with trees being removed on the left side - exposing the dangers of the barranca that guards the entire left side.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAvoid \"Devlin's Billabong\" (where Australian legend Bruce Devlin famously rinsed a couple of goes at the green, dashing his chance at the title) on No. 18. Not only does hitting the par-5 green in two require a perfectly judged carry, the water also comes into play for wedge shots, as <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/1005/Kyle-Stanley?p=1\">Kyle Stanley</a> famously found out at the Farmers in 2012. I would expect the California Golf Association to push the tees on No. 18 up at least one day, to allow matches that make it to the last hole to finish with theatrics.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Related: </b><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-course-reviews/3816/Torrey-Pines-South-Course-Review\">Torrey Pines South Course Review</a><br><br>\r\n\r\n<B>PAST CHAMPIONS</B><br><br>\r\n\r\nSome of the most famous winners of the California Amateur include San Francisco Bay Area legends Ken Venturi (1951) and Johnny Miller (1968). Bobby Clampett could sleep at home for the short drive to Pebble Beach. He won it twice, in 1978 and 1980. Mark O’Meara made the trip up to Pebble Beach from Mission Viejo, and won the title in 1979. <br><br>\r\n\r\nLets not forget the amateurs, especially friend of the company -- and anyone who has played with him or had him carry for them at Pebble Beach -- professional caddie <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/20147/Casey-Boyns\">Casey Boyns</a>. Boyns has won the title twice, but he's such a humble guy that most of the players he caddies for never even know. (If you are ever lucky enough to have Casey caddie for you - listen to his advice...)<br><br>\r\n\r\nStandout golfers who have tried to win the title and failed, include Craig Stadler, Corey Pavin, Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods. Woods reached the semifinals in 1994 before falling to Ed Cuff. The oldest champion remains Vern Callison, who won in 1967 at the age of 47. Mac Hunter is the youngest champion, having won in 1972 at the age of 16.<BR><BR>\r\nSpectators will not be allowed for the medal play portion of the championship on Monday and Tuesday July 27-28. Starting with Wednesday's matches, things open up a bit however attendees should be prepared to follow all San Diego COVID-19 safety protocols.",

    "articleText": "Addison native Aaron Hickman battled his way through four days and six rounds of mentally demanding golf in the Texas heat to come away with the Texas Mid-Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\nAfter earning medalist honors on Thursday with a 6-under 65, Hickman cruised to the championship match with 3&2, 2&1, 6&4, and 8&7 wins as the No. 1 seed.\r\n\r\nHickman’s opponent in the championship match had a similar path to Sunday’s final match. Colby Harwell, the defending champion and also a winner in 2017, commanded a spot in the main event with 2&1, 6&5, 1 up, and a 5&4 semifinal win to face off against Hickman on the Tripp Davis redesigned Willow Brook Country Club.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nQuickly pouncing out in front, Hickman took a 5 up advantage as the pair made the turn. Getting out to a fast start helped Hickman all week.\r\n\r\n“Getting that first birdie in each match helped settle the nerves,” Hickman told the Texas Golf Association. “I had four bogeys all week and played the rest of the golf at 31-under par.”\r\n\r\nHickman did not lose a hole until he lost back-to-back holes as Harwell tried to chip away. Three holes up with seven to play, Hickman needed just three more holes to settle the match.\r\n\r\nBirdies on Nos. 12 and 13 gave Hickman a 5 up lead once again. Halving the par-4 14th with Harwell, Hickman ended the match 5&4.\r\n\r\nThe Willow Brook member definitely felt the pressure on his home course but was glad he could get in done in convincing fashion.\r\n\r\n“To play in front of the home crowd brings added pressure with all of the moving parts, but the membership here was so supportive of everything this week,” Hickman said. “They are really excited to host the 2022 Texas Amateur, which is also our 100th anniversary as a club.”\r\n\r\nEven better than winning at home is the self-validation a championship like this can give you.\r\n\r\n“This is validation for all of the hard work I have put in,” said Hickman. “I have won team events, but this is special to do this on my own”.",

But mostly, The Western Amateur is known as the most grueling test as winning requires so much golf.

Thursday it's a long day of 36 holes of stroke play to determine the “Sweet-16” who compete at Match Play on Friday and Saturday (two matches each day if you're going to the finals) to decide the champion.<br><br>\r\n\r\nYou might remember Crooked Stick as the Pete Dye venue where John Daly found his way to fame and fortune (and everything in between) by coming in as the 9th alternate and wielding his long drives and deft touch around the greens to victory.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter hosting the PGA, Crooked Stick hosted the U.S. Women's Open (Laurie Merten won) in 1993, and later has hosted the WGA-conducted BMW Championship, part of the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoffs series.

Supported by 60 “interested, avid, and maybe crazy golfers” from the Indianapolis area, Dye formed a corporation to acquire a flat cornfield to be transformed into a golf course. Crooked stick has been described by the Western Golf Association as a blend of Alister Mackenzie, Donald Ross and C.B. Macdonald.<br><br>\r\n\r\nCrooked Stick came into national prominence by hosting the PGA Championship in 1991. That was the same year that the designer of the TPC Sawgrass saw another of his iconic designs gain international attention by hosting the Ryder Cup matches. That course? The Ocean Course at Kiawah Island -- Google \"War by the Shore\" if you haven't heard of it. You won't be disappointed.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>EVANS SCHOLARSHIP</B><br><br>\r\nThe Western Golf Association is not only famous for hosting professional tournaments that raise millions of dollars for worth charities. The WGA also manages the Evans Scholarship Foundation. Established in 1930 by famed golfer Charles “Chick” Evans Jr. and the WGA, the Foundation has awarded full tuition and housing scholarships to more than 11,000 caddies, including 1,010 caddies currently in school. <br><br>\r\n\r\nCrooked Stick has been a steadfast partner of the Evans Scholars Foundation for over 30 years. Twenty-four of those recipients caddied at Crooked Stick, including current Evans Scholar Joe Conway, a freshman at Purdue University. The two BMW Championships hosted by Crooked Stick raised over $6 Million for the foundation; all proceeds from the Western Amateur will go to the program as well.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>SPECTATORS</B><BR><BR>\r\n\r\nAs of virtual press time, no outside spectators will be allowed, however friends and family and members of Crooked Stick will ensure that golf claps are heard around the course. The official website announcement from the WGA follows:<br><br>\r\n<i>\r\nThe Western Golf Association has been carefully monitoring all information regarding the COVID-19 outbreak and remains focused on the health and safety of players and their families, volunteers, supporters and staff. As a result, public spectators will not be permitted to attend the championship this year. Approved player guests, Crooked Stick Members and WGA guests may attend but are required to have a mask and to practice social distancing while on-site. All approved guests will be required to: sign a COVID release waiver when they first arrive; answer a series of screening questions; and have their temperature taken daily upon arrival. Approved guests will not have access to the clubhouse and practice areas.</i>",

    "teaser": "Hugo Townsend of Sweden and Boise State University dominates the back nine for a comeback win at Elkhorn GC",
    "articleText": "You know that old saying in golf, “Sometimes a hole just fits your eye”? What if a whole nine holes that fit your eye?\r\n\r\nThe back nine at Elkhorn Golf Club might have been designed with Hugo Townsend in mind, or at least it seems like it. Townsend played the back nine at Elkhorn in a cumulative 11 strokes under par, shooting 33-31-33 throughout the week.\r\n\r\nStarting the day a stroke behind the leaders, Townsend seemed to have stalled on the front nine, making one birdie and eight pars. Things started moving very quickly though on the back nine. \r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nA bogey on 11 set him back for a moment, but a birdie on 13 put him just 2 shots back of Colt Sherrell. \r\n\r\nThen it happened.\r\n\r\nTownsend stuffed his approach on 15 and drained the putt, while Sherrell lipped out his par putt. A two shot swing.\r\n\r\nTownsend had the honor on the 16th hole, a hole that had been shortened and was certainly reachable. Instead of giving it a go he elected to lay up just short. Then he played maybe the shot of the tournament.  A crafty little bump and run into the hill in front of the green, letting it cozy to about three feet which he promptly buried for another birdie. \r\n\r\nA routine par on 17, and a bogey for Sherrell gave Townsend a two shot lead headed to the 18th, and he never looked back. A very casual birdie on 18 brought him to -10 (206) for the tournament, and a comfortable win.\r\n\r\nAfter losing his spring college season to the pandemic, Townsend sounded more relieved than excited after the round. “It just feels really good to play in a tournament. I’ve been working really hard in the gym and playing a lot with my teammates since I can’t go home (to Sweden) this summer. It just feels really good to have all the hard work pay off.”\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, there’s certainly no better pay off than having a trophy waiting.",

    "articleText": "One of California's most historic amateur championships went missing from the calendar in 2019. It wasn't Coronavirus, but a number of other factors that caused the tournament to miss a year.\r\n\r\nBut the tournament committee, and a group that includes the Brookside Men's Golf Club, Rose Bowl Operations, Brookside GC staff, and AmateurGolf.com convened to make sure that everyone knows, like our former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Pasadena City was going to \" be back.\"\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe traditional dates in April sold out -- right in the middle of golf's shutdown.\r\n\r\nDetermined not to miss a second year, the committee contacted players and a very large percentage of them decided to play on the new July dates. Any that couldn't were replaced by eager golfers form the waiting list.\r\n\r\nThe two names you might expect to do battle for the title, Dan Sullivan and Tim Hogarth, were not only there, they rose to the top.\r\n\r\nFor this year's battle, it was Hogarth (a former USGA Publinx champ who earned a spot into the Masters some years back) who defeated Sullivan (a two-time USGA Mid-Am semifinalist) by two shots.  It was Hogarth's 7th Pasadena City Championship, extending his all-time record.\r\n\r\nHogarth started slow - his first round 75 left him well back of Daniel Ragsdale (the only player to break 70 in the first round with 69). But there was no doubt that Hogarth would find a way to get into the mix, and he did just that with a nearly flawless round on Saturday - a 66 that put him into a tie for third with steady Dan Sullivan who posted rounds of 71 and 70.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, playing the same C.W. Koiner course that was used in round one -- but this time from the Gold tees -- Hogarth caught fire. Seven birdies against just a single bogey put him over the top at 7-under for the tournament, as Sullivan posted his best round of the weekend (a 68) to finish solo second. \r\n\r\nRounding out the top three, Tongun Lako shot a final round 70 to finish solo third at 4-under. The tournament should move to its traditional date in 2021, during the month of April. We're betting it will fill quickly. \r\n\r\nSouthern Californians missed the Pasadena City.",

    "teaser": "Former Cal-Berkeley standout Stephen Hale finishes 36 holes at 7 under and will be the No. 1 match play seed at Torrey Pines",
    "articleText": "Former Cal-Berkeley standout Stephen Hale took home medalist honors as the medal play portion of the California Amateur concluded on Tuesday. \r\n\r\nHale, who opened with the 6-under 66 on the North Course yesterday and shot 71 on the more difficult South  today, will be the No.1 seed when match play begins Wednesday at Torrey Pines GC.\r\n\r\nHale, who attempted a professional career but then regained his amateur status, finished stroke play qualifying with a 36-hole total of 7-under par 137.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHale told AmateurGolf.com that the round on the South Course \"was a bit of a struggle early\" but that he grinded out the round without thinking about whether he could come out on top of qualifying.\r\n\r\n\"I had no thoughts about [being] medalist all day,\" said Hale. \"I just wanted to get into the match play round and give myself a chance. It's a huge bonus to be the medalist.\"\r\n\r\nFive players, including NorCal’s Mikey Slesinski, defending NCGA Amateur champion Josh McCarthy and Matt Cohn, along with Southern Cal golfers Anthony Truong (Irvine) and Torrey Edwards (Long Beach), finished tied for second at 138. \r\n\r\nAnd the odds of a Southern California player winning got a little better going into match play; 22 of the qualifiers are from Southern California, while only 10 NorCal players made the cut, which came at 2-under 142.\r\n\r\n<b>ROUND ONE SUMMARY</b>\r\n\r\nOn a perfect day for scoring, the medal play portion of the 109th California Amateur teed off today at both the North and South Courses of Torrey Pines. \r\n\r\nAnd one of them, if he wins, might add a second R to his first name.\r\n\r\nThat would be Torey Edwards, of Long Beach, a former mini-tour journeyman who blistered his way around the host course of the U.S. Open with a 6-under 66.\r\n\r\nEdwards, who won the 2019 Long Beach City Championship and owns the course record of 58 at Long Beach's Recreation Park, is in great shape heading over to the North tomorrow, as the South is considered 2-3 shots harder than the North.\r\n\r\nAfter three straight pars to start and a birdie on a hole we featured in our preview (the cliffside fourth) Edwards found some magic as he turned to the back nine. He went 4-under on Nos. 8-10 thanks to a birdie on No. 8 (a par-3), an eagle on the par-5 9th, and another birdie at the 10th to start his back nine.\r\n\r\nAlthough he took a bogey on No. 12, anyone that has played the South can tell you that it plays almost like a par-5 and he didn't give anything back to the field there. Bouncing back with a birdie on the par-5 13th and adding another to finish on the 18th led to the low score of the day by two shots on the South for Edwards.\r\n\r\nHe played the par-5 holes in 4-under, only failing to make birdie on No. 6 but making that up with his eagle on No. 9. They are the secret to scoring on the South, especially for long hitters on warm days like today. \r\n\r\nEdwards was humble in describing his length when describing his eagle on No. 9.\r\n\r\n\"I used to be very long,\" said Edwards over email. \"Now all these youngsters kill it. I still consider myself one of the longer hitters. I hit Driver, 3 wood from 280 on 9. It stopped 7 feet away and I was able to make that.\"\r\n\r\nEdwards went on to say that he was very pleased to shoot 66 on a course as hard as the South, and beyond the length credited the position he was in off the tee with his ability to attack flags.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n\"It’s a long ball hitters golf course but very tough to score on from the rough,\" he explained. \"i  was able to put the ball in positions that allowed me to be aggressive into the greens.\"\r\n\r\nJust as Tiger Woods dominated the South for years with his length and iron prowess (and he could putt a little), a player like Edwards will be tough to beat in match play.\r\n\r\nEdwards is not alone at 6-under, however.\r\n\r\nStephen Hale of Bakersfield, a former Cal Berkeley golfer, went to work early on the North Course. Teeing off at 7:05, Hale attacked the vulnerable North Course with a quick birdie on the first hole. But the dogleg left fourth grabbed a shot back from him, but that was all it could do to fight back as Hale birdied back-to-back on Nos. 6 and 7 (both par-4s). \r\n\r\nHale, another reinstated amateur who toiled for a while on the mini tours -- playing as far away as Ecuador -- birdied consecutive holes again at the par-5 9th and 10th holes, and did it one more time on Nos. 16 and 17. \r\n\r\n\"I took advantage of the par 5s and wedge [approach shots],\" Hale told AmateurGolf.com via text. \r\n\r\n\"I didn’t do anything crazy just struck it nice and kept it in the right spots,\" he continued. \"The course was in great shape and the SCGA did a great job setting it up. You can get to a lot of the pins but if you are a little off it leaves you in tricky spots.\"\r\n\r\nIn assessing the round shot by his co-leader Edwards on the South, Hale was pretty straightforward.\r\n\r\n\"I have to think Torey’s round on the South was awesome.\"\r\n\r\nAs for the depth of the field, consider this-- a full 40-plus players (almost a third of those who teed off) posted a red number today.\r\n\r\nThe second round goes off tomorrow, with players flipping courses. No spectators will be allowed again, but starting with Wednesday's round-of-32 in match play the public can enjoy the gorgeous views of Torrey Pines. \r\n\r\nOr is it Torey Pines?",

    "articleText": "By <a href=\"https://www.thenewsstar.com/story/sports/2020/07/26/gnam-takes-cotton-states-invitational-extra-holes/5514790002/\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Hunsucker of the Monroe News-Star</a>\r\n\r\nGolfers of all levels know that you may think you’re playing golf, but sometimes golf plays you instead.\r\n\r\nJack Gnam could relate early in Sunday’s championship round at the W.E. Cole Cotton States Invitational. It wasn’t that the Ole Miss golfer was playing bad overall, but inopportune gaffes had him trailing upstart Mitchell Ford by two strokes through 13 holes.\r\n\r\n“I made a bad mistake there out of a bunker and gifted him a hole,” Gnam said. “From there on, I just decided I wasn’t going to lose this match.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nWhile keeping his cool mentally, Gnam’s game caught fire on holes 15 and 16. After sinking a putt on the 18th hole to force a sudden death playoff, Gnam outlasted Ford on the 20th hole to win the 2020 Cotton States championship at Bayou DeSiard Country Club.\r\n\r\n“I’ve been involved in this tournament for 11 years and I’ve never seen a final match go extra holes,” Cotton States tournament director Stewart Causey said. “It was a great final match with lots of ups and downs and we had quite a crowd out here to watch it.”\r\n\r\nNeeding the putt on 18 to force a playoff, Gnam never considered an outcome other than winning the hole.\r\n\r\n“I kind of had a good idea of the line and the only thing I was thinking of over the put was what I was going to do after it went it,” Gnam said. “You always say you expect it to go in, but it was a rush to have it go in.”\r\n\r\nFord, a Little Rock, Arkansas-native, started the tournament 23rd on the bracket and played his way into the championship match. He held a two-stroke lead coming off 10 and 13 and clung to a one-stroke advantage on 18.\r\n\r\n“I was so grateful to Mr. Causey for letting me in the tournament,” Ford said. “I shouldn’t have been here or in the finals. I beat a lot of people that were better than me and I’m just extremely grateful to be here.”\r\n\r\nGnam credited his comeback to a pitching adjustment following a slow start.\r\n\r\n“I just added about half a cup to my read and I did that the rest of the day,” Gnam said. “I hit maybe two bad shots, but I just wasn’t making putts and I knew I had to be patient and not let myself get mad.”",

    "teaser": "Maxwell Moldovan of Ohio (Ohio State) is among a strong fivesome posting 4-under 68 at Crooked Stick",
    "articleText": "We've been watching <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/89465/Maxwell-Moldovan\">Maxwell Moldovan</a> (Uniontown, Ohio) since his junior golf days. \r\n\r\nThe rising star aged out of his junior career in style last month in North Carolina, birdieing his final five holes to take the clubhouse lead at the AJGA Invitational, the last junior event of his career. He ended up finishing 2 shots behind eventual winner David Ford, but what a way to \"graduate\" to amateur and collegiate golf.\r\n\r\nThat was on June 12, when he told us \"I'm excited about the summer of amateur events\" - and with since he is exempt by way of making the round-of-64 at last year's U.S. Amateur, that journey will continue to Bandon Dunes in late August.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nBut for now, the big prize is the endurance test known as the Western Amateur, just four years \"younger\" (1899) than the U.S. and British Amateurs which were founded in 1895.\r\n\r\nToday at Crooked Stick Golf Club in Indianapolis, Moldovan avoided a bogey; not an easy task on such a \"big\" course that has hosted two World Golf Championships in the last 10 years.\r\n\r\nGoing out with nine straight pars, Moldovan was loving the odd numbers on the back nine, recording birdies on Nos. 11, 13, and 15. A par on No. 17 stopped the symmetry, but not the momentum -- the Ohio State freshman-to-be birdied the last to post 32 on the back nine and a 4-under 68 on the round.\r\n\r\n\"I was really happy with how I played today,\" Moldovan told AmateurGolf.com. \"The course is a great test. It’s long, it’s tight off the tee, and the greens are tough.\"\r\n\r\nThe key stretch for Moldovan was a clutch seven-footer for par on the 12th, followed by a chip-in birdie on 13. \"That kept the momentum for the closing stretch, which is really good at Crooked Stick,\" said Moldovan. \"I was able to make some good birdie putts today and lots of good chips to give myself tap-in pars.\"\r\n\r\nAlso posting 68 -- <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/167345/Connor-Creasy\">Connor Creasy</a> of Abington, Virginia. The Georgia Bulldog had five birdies and just a single bogey on No. 10. \r\n\r\nThe pair are joined at the top of the leaderboard by University of Florida commit <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/19701/Joseph-Pagdin?p=1\">Joseph Pagdin</a> of England, University of Louisville senior <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18671/Matthias-Schmid?p=1\">Mattias Schmid</a> of Germany, and Clemson senior <A href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18732/Turk-Pettit?p=1\">Turk Pettit</a>.\r\n\r\nAmong the large group of ten players one shot back at 3 under are World No. 4 <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18654/Davis-Thompson?p=1\">Davis Thompson</a> of the University of Georgia and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24757/William-Mouw?p=1\">William Mouw</a>, who chose not to defend his California Amateur title in favor of playing in the Western Amateur.\r\n\r\nAnother nine players are at 2 under, including the reigning U.S. Amateur champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/76098/Andy-Ogletree\">Andy Ogletree</a>. In all, an eye-popping 40 players are within three shots of the lead.\r\n\r\nDefending champ <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/52007/Garrett-Rank\">Garrett Rank</a> posted a disappointing 74 and will have to get some momentum going on Wednesday if he is to contend for the title as the field gets whittled down to 44 after 36-holes and those players then play an additional 36 to determine the \"sweet-16.\"\r\n\r\nAlso in the group at 74 who we predicted would do well here are <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/17104/Quade-Cummins?p=1\">Quade Cummins</a> of Oklahoma and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22047/McClure-Meissner?p=1\">McClure Meissner</a> of SMU, recent winner of the Southern Amateur at Maridoe.\r\n\r\nPlaying all of that recent golf -- Cummins just finished 3rd and 4th at the Southern Amateur and Sunnehanna in back to back weeks -- can wear on a person, but don't be surprised to see any of those three players post a low number on Wednesday in an attempt to move on.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, Moldovan also played the last two \"majors\" but finished outside of the top-30 in both events.",

The second round was cut short due to darkness after weather delayed play.\r\n\r\nUnable to replicate her near-perfect 6-under 30 on the front nine from the first round, Kuehn birdied the par-4 first and then added nine pars before play was suspended.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nWaiting in the wings just one shot behind Kuehn is Louisville’s Lauren Thibodeau. After an opening 68, Thibodeau was even par through the front side Tuesday with a birdie on No. 7 canceling out a bogey on No. 9.\r\n\r\nAmong the handful to finish their rounds were Carly Burkhardt (Furman) and Brooke Riley (Northwestern). The pair sit just three shots behind Kuehn at 3 under. With Riley putting together a one-under 71 and Burkhardt carding a 3-under 69, they are in a decent position to attack when the third round commences following the conclusion of the remainder of the second round Wednesday morning.\r\n\r\nBurkhardt and Riley are joined by SMU’s Kennedy Pedigo at 3-under. Pedigo, through 16 holes, looks to make up some more ground before the third round begins.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of second-round play, the field will be cut to top-60 and ties as the event heads to the final round on Wednesday.",

Part of our mission to grow the game is about welcoming all and bringing diversity to the sport.\"\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Detroit Golf Club's board of directors obtained by The News on Monday, the tournament committee said: \"In support of the recent decision by the PGA to change the name of the Horton Smith Award to the PGA Development Award, the Horton Smith Committee will remove Horton Smith’s name from our championship. Effective immediately, the tournament will be the Michigan Medal Play at Detroit Golf Club.\"\r\n\r\nThe invitational is held in the spring, and has taken place at Detroit Golf Club every year since 1964, the year after Smith died.\r\n\r\nIn 1971, the tournament merged with the Michigan Medal Play — which was played at a rotating series of Metro Detroit clubs — and is a 72-hole stroke-play championship with a 36-hole cut.\r\n\r\nSmith won the first Masters in 1934, won it again in 1936 and had 32 PGA Tour wins. He's a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame and Michigan Golf Hall of Fame.\r\n\r\nSmith was head pro at Detroit Golf Club from 1946 until his death. He was president of the PGA of American from 1952-54. \r\n\r\nOne notable exception to the whites-only rule Smith trumpeted during his tenure as PGA president came in January 1952, when Detroit legend and boxing great Joe Louis — who picked up golf in retirement, notably at Rackham in Huntington Woods — was allowed to play in a tournament in San Diego in 1952.\r\n\r\nMultiple times in the last several weeks, The News has reached out to Detroit Golf Club officials to inquire about the future of the tournament's name. General manager Derek Jacques and head professional Josh Upson didn't return messages, and club president Mark Douglas declined to comment on the matter, saying the tournament isn't officially run by the club but rather a committee.\r\n\r\n\"We are just the host course,\" Douglas said.\r\n\r\nThe tournament, which was canceled this year because of COVID-19, was the biggest annual event at Detroit Golf Club until two years ago, when the club landed the PGA Tour's Rocket Mortgage Classic.",

Holding a one-stroke lead over the field heading into Wednesday’s final round, the 2019 Pennsylvania Golf Association Amateur Player of the Year went from 7 under to 11 under in the blink of an eye.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nBut just as quickly, he fell back to earth, dropping bogeys on Nos. 5, 6, and 7. Gaining a shot back with a birdie on No. 8, Brown capped off his electric front side with a par on No. 9 for an eventful 2-under 34.\r\n\r\nBrown leveled out on the back nine with a single birdie on No. 10 and eight consecutive pars to hold off a pair of surging competitors for a 206 total and a one-shot victory.\r\n\r\nRick Stimmel and William Davenport came up just short in their efforts to chase down Brown. Stimmel, who began the day three back of Brown, posted a 5-under 67 which included two eagles (Nos. 8 and 13).

Making it up on 17, the error proved to be the difference between a T-2 and a possible playoff.\r\n\r\nBrown credited an attitude adjustment for securing the title.\r\n\r\n“The reason I didn’t succeed as a professional was my self-image wasn’t as strong as it needed to be,” said Brown to the Pennsylvania Golf Association. “I told myself this morning, ‘Who here is more prepared for today and Lookaway?’ I said ‘Nobody.’ I spent last night and this morning pumping myself up because I believed I could win.

He's coming off 3rd and 4th place finishes at the Southern and Sunnehanna Amateurs -- two \"<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/amateur-golf-tournaments/TheMajorsOfAmateurGolf\">Majors of Amateur Golf</a>\" -- and today he roared back with a birdie-eagle run at Nos. 8 and 9 to shoot 32 on the front, and has recorded another birdie on the back to get to 3-under on the tournament. Cleanly under the 36-hole cut, Cummins can focus on making it to the \"Sweet-16\" tomorrow.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAnother guy to watch heading into match play is <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/76098/Andy-Ogletree\">Andy Ogletree</a>. The winner of the 2019 U.S. Amateur is ready to defend at Bandon Dunes in late August. At 6-under after 36-holes, he seems poised to make a run here and perhaps bring a little more hardware with him to Oregon. We certainly wouldn't bet against him if he makes the Sweet-16.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/63762/Ricky-Castillo\">Ricky Castillo</a>, of Yorba Linda, California, and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/23234/Alexander-Yang?p=1\">Alexander Yang</a>, of Carlsbad, California, are both at 5-under. Castillo, who made match play last year, was also on everyone's early Western Amateur watch list.\r\n\r\nAnother Californian, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24757/William-Mouw?p=1\">William Mouw</a> of Chino, appears to be validating his decision to forego a California Amateur title defense to play in the Western. After two rounds of 69, Mouw sits at 6-under and well-positioned for a Sweet-16 run.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24499/Preston-Summerhays?p=1\">Preston Summerhays</a>, the reigning U.S. Junior champion who won last week's Sunnehanna Amateur, shot a 70 to make the cut at 1 under par, two shots out of the 16th spot.\r\n\r\nThe cut fell at even par, with 46 players at or below that number. Among those missing out is the defending champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/52007/Garrett-Rank\">Garrett Rank</a> of Canada, who shot rounds of 74-73 to fall three shots short. <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/19645/John-Pak?p=1\">John Pak</a>, who recently debuted at No. 1 in the first-ever <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/27220/John-Pak-tops-first-ever-PGA-Tour-University-ranking\">PGA Tour University Ranking</a>, missed the cut by two shots.\r\n\r\nOthers whose tournament ended after two rounds include the recent Southern Amateur winner <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22047/McClure-Meissner?p=1\">McClure Meissner</a>, the U.S. Amateur runner-up <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18421/John-Augenstein?p=1\">John Augenstein</a>, and 2018 British Amateur champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/13009/Jovan-Rebula?p=1\">Jovan Rebula</a>.\r\n\r\nTwo rounds will be played on Thursday, with a playoff if need to pare the field down to the Sweet 16 who will advance to match play.",

    "articleText": "For the first time in history, the California Amateur was contested at Torrey Pines this week. Today, the championship culminated with a 36-hole match play final won by Joey Vrzich of nearby El Cajon.<br><br>\r\n\r\nVrzich was one of four Pepperdine Waves to advance to the round-pf-16 in match play -- not surprising given the Div. 1 golf team's No. 1 national ranking at the end of the shortened NCAA season.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen three of his teammates (Dylan Menante, Braden Fioroni, and Josh McCarthy) were eliminated on Thursday, Vrzich was left to represent the Waves (and keep the title won by a teammate last year), and boy did he ever.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith defending champ and fellow Wave William Mouw competing at the Western Amateur at Crooked Stick, Vrzich got down to business in today's final against Charlie Reiter of Palm Desert, and University of San Diego.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe pair traded off pars and birdies in the morning, with both posting sub-70 medal play equivalent scores at the tough Torrey Pines South Course, and Vrzich taking a narrow 1-up advantage to the lunch break after 18 holes.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, it looked like Vrzich would run away with it, taking the first hole with a par, the third with a birdie, and the cliffside fourth with a par. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBut Reiter fought back, bringing things back within two holes after a birdie at No. 7, the hole where Tiger Woods famously defeated Rocco Mediate after their 18-hole sudden death round ended deadlocked at the 2008 U.S. Open.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNever giving up the 2-up advantage, Vrzich finally put the match dormie with a birdie on No. 15, the match's 33rd hole. He won it at the par-3 16th when both players made par. <br><br>\r\n\r\nVrzich is exempt to play. in the U.S. Amateur at the end of the month at Bandon Dunes.

Triplett liked what he saw.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“What didn’t impress me about Sam?,” replied Triplett when asked by about his partner at the time. “He’s a fabulous player with a fabulous swing. He’s also got tremendous poise and has the ability to bounce back.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nThose are the qualities that allowed Sommerhauser to come back from 2-down after 10 holes, winning the tough par-3 11th with a par, and the par-5 13th with a birdie, before making eagle on the par-4 14th -- where the front tee location allowed players to have a go at the green. <br><br>\r\n\r\nA birdie at No. 17 was the difference for Sommerhauser, in what would be one of the tightest matches of the day he won 1-up. That's the same margin that <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/25521/Harrison-Kingsley?p=1\">Harrison Kingsley</a> needed to defeat Pepperdine Wave <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/26447/Caden-Fioroni?p=1\">Caden Fioroni</a> of San Diego. <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24558/Dylan-Menante?p=1\">Dylan Menante</a> of Carlsbad, the third Wave to go out in the first round, lost to <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/64206/Alex-Chin\">Alexander Chin</a> of Pleasanton.

Heating up with another birdie on No. 11, Ingram knocked home a pair of birdies on Nos. 13 and 14. The soon-to-be senior at Rome (Ga.) High School capped off the low round of the day with a birdie on 18 for a bogey-free 65, and the clubhouse lead.\r\n\r\nAs the leaders came in, the class of 2021 Georgia Southern commit saw his name stay atop the leaderboard, claiming his second tournament win in the past calendar month. Winning the Georgia Junior Championship in June, Ingram is proving to himself as well as others that he can get the job done.\r\n\r\n“It’s awesome just to be able to compete with all the great college players here is unreal,” Ingram told WTVC News Channel 9. “To be able to come out on top is even better.”\r\n\r\nAmong those college players was Tennessee’s Chip Thomas. The Vol began Wednesday just a single shot behind Vukovits. Posting a 3-under 68, Thomas fell a shot short of Ingram.\r\n\r\nFinishing in solo third-place was East Tennessee State’s Campbell Wolf.

Kuehn carded two more birdies to close out the second round at 8-under-par.\r\n\r\nPlaying the final round uninterrupted, Kuehn was able to find a rhythm and stick to it.\r\n\r\nThrough nine holes, Kuehn traded two bogeys and two birdies to carry her 8-under total into the final stretch. Coming home, she carded birdies on Nos. 15 and 17 to move to 10-under, securing a six-shot victory.\r\n\r\nThe LNGA handed out three exemptions into next week’s U.S. Women’s Amateur, with Kuehn taking one of the exemptions despite already being locked into the field. Kennedy Pedigo (SMU) and Marissa Wenzler (Kentucky) earned the other two exemptions as they tied for second at 4-under. Both Pedigo and Wenzler were exempt into the U.S. Amateur field prior to this week’s event.\r\n\r\nBrooke Riley (Northwestern), Carly Burkhardt (Furman) and Kynadie Adams (Tennessee) tied for fourth at 3 under par.",

I really had control of the ball and drove it well all three days.”\r\n\r\nThat was until Wednesday’s final round where Bull self-admittedly felt shaky with the flat stick.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“Today, I hate to admit it, but I was nervous with the putter most of the day,” he said. “I had a lot of opportunities but didn’t make any of them, other than a par putt on No. 5… I was really happy with the way I played today.”\r\n\r\nAs he built a five-shot cushion over the first two rounds of the championship with an opening 5-under 65 and a 1-under 69, Bull knew the rest of his game could carry him through the final 18.\r\n\r\nCoasting through the front side at 1-under, Bull faltered slightly with a bogey on No. 10. Gaining the dropped stroke back on the par-5 13th, he fell stagnant on the day once again with a bogey on the 14th.\r\n\r\n“Obviously someone is going to make a run,” Bull said following his closing 69. “I just tried to stay patient and hit greens. I tried not to make mistakes coming in. There are some pins out here you just can’t go at.”\r\n\r\nThe Norwalk, Iowa native not only carried his overnight lead to a championship win, but he built off of it, winning by six shots.\r\n\r\nFinishing runner-up as the only other competitor under-par was 2020 Iowa Golf Association Match Play winner Connor Peck. Peck, a University of Kansas senior, closed out the tournament with an even-par 70 for a 209 (-1) total.\r\n\r\nBull used past experiences to take home the IGA Amateur as he worked at Davenport Country Club as a cart attendant in exchange for playing privileges.\r\n\r\n“I have played here (at DCC) 15-20 times here prior to this event,” Bull said. “I worked the cart barn out here one or two nights a week (several years ago), so I could play out here.”\r\n\r\nGriffin Parker (Northern Iowa) and Trent Lindenman tied for third at 1-over-par.",

That's something you don't see every day.\"\r\n\r\nThe dramatic ending by Manuel allowed him to finish the tourney with a 9-under 67-66=133, setting a junior amateur record for low score and tying the record for relation to par.\r\n\r\nOuellette, who made the eagle putt on 18, finished with an 8-under 66-68=134.\r\n\r\nThe two players battled throughout the final round. Ouellete had a one-shot lead at the start of the round and went up two shots with a birdie on the sixth hole. But Manuel battled back and tied the match with a birdie on the 15th hole. The pair was tied again after the 17th hole, setting up the amazing finish.\r\n\r\nManuel is scheduled to play in The Maine Event, a tourney limited to only Maine professionals and amateurs, on Aug. 12-13 at Augusta Country Club, before he heads to Storrs for his freshman year.",

Unceremoniously consistent, Longbella saw his lead grow larger and larger as the field simply could not muster any red numbers to give him a run for his money.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing changes,\" said Longbella. \"Yeah I do have a six-shot lead, but I'm still going out there playing the same golf course I played the first three days.

Posting a 1-over-par 72, Sajevic was able to tread water as Freeman and others faltered in the breeze.\r\n\r\n“With 72-holes, you know it’s going to be a marathon,” the 29-year-old told the Nebraska Golf Association. “I hit it well and made some putts when I needed to.”\r\n\r\nStaying bogey-free through 16 holes, Sajevic was 1-under before closing the tournament with back-to-back bogeys. Although not finishing in the best fashion, he picked up the win with a 3-under 281 total and joins Alex Schaake, Rod Bliss Jr., Sam Reynolds, and Bob Astleford on the shortlist of four-time Nebraska Amateur winners.\r\n\r\nFreeman carded a final-round 76 (284), finishing runner-up to Sajevic just as he did in 2013. University of Nebraska's Tom Westenberger took home a third-place finish at 2-over-par (286). Iowa Western sophomore Grant Jabenis snagged fourth place at 3-over (287).",

    "articleText": "Having a flair for the dramatic, 14-year-old William Jennings (Greenville, South Carolina) needed a comeback and two playoff holes to claim the 2020 Carolinas Junior Boys’ Championship.\r\n\r\nFour shots back of 36-hole leader Griffin Tarver (Tega Cay, South Carolina), Jennings caught fire early, making birdies on holes 4, 5, and 6. Falling back to 1-under on the day following bogeys on holes 7 and 8, Jennings capped off the front side with a birdie on No. 9.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nDespite the small stumble, Jennings felt confident.\r\n\r\n“After making that putt on No. 6, I felt confident and knew that I had a good chance to be in contention,” Jennings told the Carolinas Golf Association.\r\n\r\n6-under for the tournament through nine, Jennings knew he had to make something happen as the leaders were a group behind him. In that last group was then-leader Gene Zeigler (Florence, South Carolina). At 10-under as Jennings made the turn, Zeigler was the rabbit that needed to be chased down.\r\n\r\n“I went 4-under on the back nine [Wednesday], so I knew I could go low,” Jennings said. “I had to do that, and it happened.”\r\n\r\nPosting a 2-under back nine, Jennings headed into the clubhouse at 8-under, needing a bit of help from Zeigler in the form of at least a couple of bogeys. Zeigler obliged with bogeys on 16 and 18 to set up a playoff with Jennings.\r\n\r\n“It was nerve-wracking standing and watching Gene finish,” Jennings said. “I honestly thought I had lost, but he gave me an opening so I took it.”\r\n\r\nThe duo both birdied the par-5 18th on the first playoff hole. Playing the closing hole for a third time that day, Jennings found that the third time is the charm. Sliding an eagle putt by, his birdie bested Zeigler’s par for the win.\r\n\r\n“I was worried that Gene was going to chip it in for birdie, but after the chip, I knew that I could two-putt for birdie and win,” said Jennings. “When my putt finally went in, I just felt relieved. Last week I lost by one stroke, so this win feels even better.”\r\n\r\nRounding out the top-5 were Max Green (Hilton Head Island, South Carolina) at 6-under (204), Griffin Tarver (205), and Tyler DeChellis (Clayton, North Carolina) who finished at 4-under (206).",

    "articleText": "The month of July is typically a time when the USGA puts its Open championships in the rearview mirror and starts looking ahead to the heart of its amateur schedule.\r\n\r\nBut these are not normal times. COVID-19 has changed everything and the USGA is not immune. Ten of its 14 championships were canceled, while the Association’s two oldest amateur championships – the U.S. Women’s Amateur and U.S. Amateur – are being contested in their originally scheduled slots, albeit with smaller fields and strict protocols.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nBecause of health and safety concerns, the USGA had to make the difficult decision to cancel all qualifying and resort to an all-exempt field.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Women’s Amateur at Woodmont Country Club in Rockville, Md., will feature a field of 132 competitors rather than the typical 156. Here’s a look at three of the 2020 exemptions:\r\n\r\n<b>Play-In Games</b>\r\n\r\nUnder normal circumstances, the few big summer women’s events on the competition calendar provide an opportunity for players to raise their profile in the Women’s World Amateur Golf Ranking® (WAGR). In 2020, some of these events are offering exemptions into the U.S. Women’s Amateur. The winners and runners-up of the Women’s North & South Amateur, the Women’s Western Amateur and Ladies National Amateur (formerly the Trans-National) all get into the field.\r\n\r\nThree players managed to earn spots at Woodmont by virtue of their play in these events. Jackie Lucena, a University of California-Davis rising junior, reached the final of the 120th Women’s Western Amateur, falling to previously exempt player Brigitte Thibault, of Canada.\r\n\r\nTwo players earned Women’s Am spots in the 90th Ladies National Golf Association Amateur, formerly called the Trans-National, on July 29. Exempt player Rachel Kuehn, who also captured the Women’s North & South at Pinehurst three weeks ago, won by six strokes. University of Kentucky rising sophomore Marissa Wenzler and Southern Methodist rising junior Kennedy Pedigo shared second to earn their way to Woodmont.\r\n\r\nThe other finalist in the 118th Women’s North & South – Allisen Corpuz – was also already in the U.S. Women’s Amateur and didn’t need the exemption.\r\n\r\n<b>Ranking Expanded</b>\r\n\r\nSince 2012, the USGA has been utilizing the WAGR to help determine exemptions for its championships. For elite international players, it means not having to fly thousands of miles to play in a qualifier. Since adopting the criteria, the USGA has exempted the top 25 points leaders into the Women’s Amateur. That number was expanded to 75 for the 2020 championship, opening the door for players such as No. 49 Kaleigh Telfer, of South Africa and No. 65 Pilar Echeverria, of Guatemala, to get into the field.\r\n\r\nRecognizing that the U.S. Women’s Amateur usually has a contingent of junior qualifiers, the USGA added a special WAGR category for the top 20 points leaders who don’t turn 19 prior to Aug. 9, the last day of the championship. One player took advantage of this exemption: incoming Stanford freshman Sadie Englemann.\r\n\r\n<b>2019 Performances</b>\r\n\r\nWhen Grace Summerhays left SentryWorld, in Stevens Point, Wis., after being eliminated in the Round of 16 of the 2019 U.S. Girls’ Junior, she was thrilled about the great run in her first USGA event. A week earlier, older brother Preston had won the U.S. Junior Amateur at Inverness Club, in Toledo, Ohio, so the family was already in a celebratory mood. Little did Grace know just how valuable that performance was last July. Under the revised exemption categories, any player reaching the Round of 16 in the 2019 U.S. Girls’ Junior got a spot in the field, making Summerhays one of nine players to get in strictly through that category.\r\n\r\nA couple of U.S. Women’s Mid-Amateur champions, Meghan Stasi (4) and Lauren Greenlief (1)  also made the field at Woodmont in a 2020-only category, thanks to being  semifinalists in last year’s championship at Forest Highlands Golf Club, in Flagstaff, Ariz..\r\n\r\nAnother beneficiary was seven-time USGA champion Ellen Port, who got into the field via her 2016 U.S. Senior Women’s Amateur triumph. She is the only senior player (50 and older) in the field. Two years ago at The Golf Club of Tennessee, she advanced to match play, one month shy of her 57th birthday.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/championships/2020/u-s--women-s-amateur/articles/2020-u-s--women-s-amateur-field.html\" target=\"_blank\">The list of 132 golfers currently in the 2020 U.S. Women's Amateur field can be found here</a>.",

Ogletree, the ninth-ranked player in the world and the defending U.S. Amateur champion, kept his hopes alive by making a par on No. 17 after hitting his tee ball into the water hazard.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAfter each player parred No. 1, Castillo closed out Ogletree, who was a senior at Georgia Tech this past season, with a par. Castillo carded five birdies and an eagle, while Ogletree finished with four birdies and an eagle.\r\n\r\n“Andy is such a good player, and it was a great match,” Castillo said. “It was back and forth. You had to hit good shots and make birdies to win holes.”\r\n\r\nIn the morning round, Castillo beat <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22608/Harrison-Ott?p=1\">Harrison Ott</a>, of Brookfield, Wisconsin, 2 and 1. Castillo tied the match with a birdie at No. 14 and then eagled the par-5 15th. He took a 2-up lead with par at No. 16.\r\n\r\n“It was a long day, but it was a fun day,” Castillo said.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/23817/George-Duangmanee?p=1\">George Duangmanee</a>, of Fairfax, Virginia, a freshman at Virginia, pulled off the biggest surprise of the day by defeating <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18654/Davis-Thompson?p=1\">Davis Thompson</a>, of Saint Simons Island, Georgia. Thompson, a senior at Georgia and the fourth-ranked player in the world, was the medalist last year.\r\n\r\nTrailing 5 down through six, Duangmanee, the 208th-ranked player, won seven of the last 12 holes to defeat Thompson in 19.\r\n\r\n“Honestly, I was almost ready to go home because he was playing insane golf,” Duangmanee said. “But I stayed patient and waited for my opportunities to come, and I capitalized on them.”\r\n\r\nDuangmanee will play <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22195/Pierceson-Coody?p=1\">Pierceson Coody</a>, of Plano, Texas, in Saturday’s semifinals. Coody, a sophomore at Texas, beat <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/167345/Connor-Creasy\">Connor Creasy</a>, of Abingdon, Virginia, 5 and 4 in the quarters. <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18384/Rasmus-Neergaard-Petersen?p=1\">Rasmus Neergaard-Petersen</a>, of Copenhagen, Denmark, and a junior at Oklahoma State, earned a date with Castillo in the semis after defeating <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/19785/Austin-Hitt?p=1\">Austin Hitt</a>, of Longwood, Florida, 2 and 1.\r\n\r\nThe semifinals will start at 7:30 a.m. on Saturday, with the championship match scheduled for Saturday afternoon. The winner will hoist the George R. Thorne Trophy.\r\n\r\n“That win gave me a lot of confidence going into (Saturday), but I have to be patient and worry only about myself,” Duangmanee said.\r\n\r\nAdded Castillo, “Hopefully, I am able to win it this year, but there’s a lot of golf left. If I keep playing solid, I know I have a chance. I’m excited.”",

Coody took a 2-up lead again with a par at No. 14 -- a monstrous par-4 over 480 yards -- but gave it back with a bogey at another 480-plus par-4, No. 16. <br><br>\r\n\r\nCoody, after seeing his lead cut in half, had a few moments of trepidation at the par-3 17th, one of the toughest of the day and playing right into the wind over water. Thinking his ball was in the bunker, he and his caddie approached it only to see -- nothing. With the ball nowhere in sight, his heart started beating a a little faster.  <br><br>\r\n\r\n“Seventeen into the wind,” Coody said to the Indy Star. “It’s just brutal.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut after he and his caddie located it hiding in a drain, he took a free drop (outside the bunker) chipped from an awkward lie onto the green and made a 20-foot par save to close out Neergaard-Petersen. <br><br>\r\n\r\n“I kind of had a feeling he was going to make it,” Neergaard-Petersen said of Coody’s last putt. “He had a great chip.”<br><br>\r\n\r\n\"The Western Amateur is one of the biggest events of the year,\" Coody said after the victory. \"To see my name next to that list of names is humbling and amazing.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nCoody is the 7th Texas Longhorn golfer to win the prestigious title, and the list portends well for his golf future. Starting with Rik Massengale in 1968, the list goes on to include Ben Crenshaw (1973); Justin Leonard (1992 & 1993); John Klauk (2002); <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/8470/Beau-Hossler?p=1\">Beau Hossler</a> (2014) and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/15400/Cole-Hammer?p=1\">Cole Hammer</a> (2018).<br><br>\r\n\r\nHe's been around the game his entire life - playing golf with his twin brother Parker (who also plays for Texas) and caddying for grandfather Charles, the 1971 Masters champion, in the par-3 contest at Augusta National. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Parker and Pierceson Coody from their caddie days <a href=\"https://t.co/0PANLcU1nk\">pic.twitter.com/0PANLcU1nk</a></p>— Brentley Romine (@BrentleyGC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrentleyGC/status/1133421865400193025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 28, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><br>\r\n\r\nNeergaard-Peterson, who plays for Oklahoma State, decided to stay in the U.S. after the spring NCAA season was cut short, due to the lack of tournaments in Denmark.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I could have gone home, but there wouldn’t have been any tournaments to play in,” he told Golf Oklahoma after winning the Oklahoma Stroke Play at 14 under. “So I’m going to play here all summer.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt was a wise decision.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062362.jpg\"><br>Rasmus Neergaard-Petersen</div></div>Although he came up short today at Crooked Stick, the 2018 and 2019 German International champ would have earned a guaranteed spot in the U.S. Amateur, but he didn't need it after the USGA included him in the list of exempt players when the field was published on July 27. <br><br>\r\n\r\nCoody, who was exempt using a number of criteria -- including his final 16 U.S. Am finish at Pinehurst in 2019 -- is one to watch at Bandon Dunes.

Neergaard-Petersen should work his way into the mix as well, after building confidence all summer in the U.S. and likely having seen all sorts of weather in his European upbringing.\r\n\r\nAs for the <a href=\"USGA to exempt winners, runners-up of 4 AM majors into the US AM\">U.S. Amateur exemptions for the top two players in \"lead-up\" tournaments</a>, all of them seem to have gone to players who would have been exempt.

Carding rounds of 69-66-64-65 (-24), Sargent shattered the tournament scoring record by six shots (264). The previous scoring record of 270 was set back in 2018 by Matt Lorenz at Pine Tree Country Club.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAt 17-years-old Sargent is the youngest winner of the even in the modern era. After holing 10 birdies and making two of his four bogeys on the week en route to a third-round 64, he took a four-stroke lead into Saturday’s final round at Saughahatchee Country Club over Alabama-Birmingham’s Drew Mathers.\r\n\r\nMaybe more impressive than Sargent’s performance this week was the depth of the Alabama Amateur field. South Alabama junior Jacob LeCroy also broke the scoring record posted by Lorenz in 2018 with a 269. Shooting a third round 63, LeCroy had an opportunity to keep Sargent in his crosshairs. Unfortunately for LeCroy, his record-breaking performance was not enough this week as he came up five shots short of Sargent, securing a solo second-place finish despite shooting a 65 on Saturday.\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t trying to sit back and let him take it,” LeCroy told the Alabama Golf Association. “But he did. I broke the total, but he shattered it. He is the best golfer I’ve played with in a long time, and he’s on his way up.”\r\n\r\nMathers also had high praise for Sargent.\r\n\r\n“Today, there was no catching Gordon,” Mathers said. “I would’ve had to shoot 60 to beat him by one overall. Hats off to him.”\r\n\r\nAs for Sargent himself, he’s definitely ready to get things going at Bandon.\r\n\r\n“It’s nice to put it all together and make some birdies,” Sargent said. “This gives me major momentum heading into the U.S. Amateur.”",

    "articleText": "Carrollton’s Serena Shah, an SMU Junior, outlasted the field at the Texas Women’s stroke play championship. Battling tough conditions at Crown Colony Country Club, Shah posted rounds of 76-71-77 (224) to clear her competition by a single shot. \r\n\r\nStaying near the top of the leaderboard all week, Shah slept on the lead Friday as the event went into its final round. Carding a 77 on Saturday, Shah had a simple game plan heading into the championship round.\r\n\r\n“This is a really tough course and it’s tight off the fairway, so just going in with the same mentality I did from the practice round to the first round to the second round was just to keep things simple,” Shah told the TGA. “Hit the fairway, hit the green and two-putt from there.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAfter completing the remaining four holes of the second round due to weather on Friday, Shah got to work on the final 18 holes.\r\n\r\nNot able to get much going, Shah kept the damage to a minimum with a front side 2-over 38. Making the turn, that’s when Shah made things interesting. Beginning on No. 9, Shah made four-straight bogeys to put herself at 5-over on the day. Tacking another bogey on No. 15, Shah scrambled to close her final three holes at 1-under-par.\r\n\r\n“Everything was going pretty well on the front nine and then on the back nine I had a little trouble,” Shah said. “I had a couple bogeys on 10, 11 and 12 and then I think the real turning point was on 16 where I had a birdie putt that I made from 8 feet, and that just kind of helped with my momentum going into the last 2 holes. I think that really helped just finish off the last three holes in a good style.”\r\n\r\nThe birdie on No. 16 proved to be the difference-maker as Zoe Paige Slaughter posted a 73 to finish at 9-over for the event, one shot off of Shah’s pace.\r\n\r\nJennie Park (+11) took solo third. Nicole Viver (+14) finished in solo fourth and Brooke Nolte took home a solo fifth-place finish at 15-over.",

    "articleText": "NC State freshman <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/27922/Nicholas-Mathews?p=1\">Nicholas Mathews</a> duked it out against East Carolina senior <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21554/Tim-Bunten?p=1\">Tim Bunten</a> for the 11th annual North Carolina Amateur Match Play Championship.\r\n\r\nMathews and Bunten had similar paths to the championship match. As the 18-seed, Mathews went 5&4, 2&1, 2 up, and 5&4 on his way through the lower half of the bracket. His biggest upset came in the second round as Mathews defeated 2-seeded Austin Bonfiglio 5&4.\r\n\r\nBunten, the 29-seed in the 32-man match-play event, opened the Round of 32 with a 2&1 win over 4-seed Garrett Risner. Following the upset with 1 up, 4&3, and 3&2 wins on his way to facing Mathews.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nIn Sunday’s championship match Mathews never trailed and allowed Bunten just three wins throughout the match. Kicking things off with a par on the first, Mathews took a 1 up advantage early. Alternating wins with Bunten on holes 2 and 3, Mathews grew upon his lead with three wins over holes 4 through 7. Taking a 4 up lead over Bunten into the backside, Mathews let him back into the match. \r\n\r\nBunten chipped away with wins on holes 10, 14, and 16 while earning halves on five of the last seven holes to get Mathews’ lead to just 1 up with two to play.\r\n\r\n“I just did a great job staying focused, staying calm, and just trusting my game plan and fortunately it worked out,” Mathews told the Carolinas Golf Association. “Going into No. 17 I had a one-up lead and I just knew I needed to stay calm and keep doing what I was doing.”\r\n\r\nHe executed just as he had visualized making a par on the par-5 17th to claim a 2&1 victory.\r\n\r\n“Anytime you get it done, and frankly anytime you play well coming down the stretch it’s always momentum and that momentum keeps you working hard,” Mathews said. “It’s something you call back on in times of pressure. I think it’s just validation that I’m doing the right stuff and it's just a matter of continuing to work hard and continuing to focus on what I need to do.” \r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Mathews, that momentum will have to wait to be unleashed as the ACC announced last week that men’s and women’s golf will have to forego their fall seasons due to COVID-19. The earliest Mathews can hit the links for the Wolfpack will (hopefully) come in the spring of 2021.",

Beginning the day at 10-under and 9-under respectively, Prater carded a 4-under 66 to Bryant’s 1-over 71 to win by six shots. After Bryant three-putted the first hole, Prater took a share of the lead and ran with it.\r\n\r\nWith the win, Prater becomes the first competitor in 11 years to win both the CGA stroke and match play events (<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/1116/Steve-Ziegler?p=1\">Steve Ziegler</a>, 2009). Add in the fact that Prater was also the low-am at the Colorado Open and he has himself a ‘Colorado Triple Crown’.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nPrater is the first to be low-am at the Colorado Open and win both amateur titles since Gary Longfellow did it in 1974, the first mid-am to win the stroke play championship since Jonathan Marsico in 2008. The six-stroke victory was the largest margin of victory since 2003 when Kane Webber won by seven.\r\n\r\n“I drove it really solid all week and that’s one of the first things out here that you need to do — and that maybe is a touch underrated,” Prater told the Colorado Golf Association. “Besides hitting the tee ball in the bunker (on 9), I never really had a poor tee-ball all week. I might have missed four or five fairways all week. Other than that I drove it really solid. That gave me a clean ball into the green. Then if I was able to control my iron shots, I’d give myself a good look at a birdie.”\r\n\r\nAs for how special his win was in the record books?\r\n\r\n“It hasn’t sunk in yet, but it’s cool,” he said. “I’m super fortunate. I started playing well to start the summer. The swing has felt solid and I feel like I’m getting better.”\r\n\r\nAll in all, the 25-year-old high school science teacher and golf coach has had quite the summer vacation.\r\n\r\nAs for Bryant, he’ll lick his wounds before heading west to compete in the U.S. Amateur at Bandon Dunes.",

Picking up two more wins (3&2, 1 up) the stage was set for the duo on Sunday.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe 36-hole marathon had plenty of parody with three lead changes. Wall pounced early, taking a 2 up lead through No. 5. Sample countered quickly with wins on holes 6, 7, and 9 to give himself a 1 up advantage at the quarter mark.\r\n\r\nSample would continue to press after a four-hole stalemate to kick off the first back nine. 3 down through 17, Wall began his comeback. \r\n\r\n“I really liked the way I started, just consistent to start off right out of the gate,” Wall told the Metropolitan Golf Association. “I just made some solid pars and got my bearings, but then Luke really made a push over the last 13 holes [of the morning].”\r\n\r\nWinning the 18th hole before the break, Wall went to work on the second 18. \r\n\r\nHe won the 22nd, and 23rd holes of the match to get it back to all square as the duo stood on the 24th tee. 2-up through 29, Wall began to put the match away with wins on holes 30, 32, and 34 en route to the 4&2 win.\r\n\r\n“I think getting it back to 2 really gave me some confidence to come back out here and work hard and try and get it back,” Wall said.\r\n\r\nSample was a pesky out all week. He battled through a nine-hole playoff following the stroke-play round to earn the 16th and final spot before making his remarkable run to the championship match at Bethpage Black. Because of the run made by Sample, Wall can cherish his win a bit more.\r\n\r\n“I think this one definitely means the most and is the biggest just because it’s such a great field of great amateurs in our area so I would rank it on the top of the list for sure,” said Wall. “Especially to do it here at Bethpage Black which has so much history and so many great winners like Brooks Koepka and all of them, it’s truly amazing and I’m very blessed to have done it here.” Thursday was the first time that Wall played the course, saying he sometimes plays better going into a course blind because he doesn't think of all the possible trouble. He fired a 1-over 72 on Thursday, taking the No. 15 seed into match play and on to victory.”",

    "articleText": "Even as tropical storm Isaias bears down on the greater Washington D.C. area, the show went on at Woodmont Country Club in Rockville, Maryland.\r\n\r\nThe morning wave caught a break as the rain from Isaias did not arrive until early afternoon. Among those in the morning wave was defending champion Gabriela Ruffels (USC). Paired with red hot North & South winner Rachel Kuehn (Wake Forest) and Western winner Brigitte Thibault (Fresno State), Ruffles stayed steady as she carded an even-par 72.\r\n\r\n“There was extra pressure, extra nerves, especially with the whole year that's been going on,” Ruffels told the USGA. “It's been a long wait to get here, but I'm happy with how I did today and how I handled those first-round nerves.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nKuehn kept her torrid pace as she holds a share lead following the first round. Posting a 4-under 68, Kuehn knocked home six birdies and two bogeys to hold a two-way split as the field gets ready for the final 18 holes of medal play. Coming off of back-to-back major wins (North & South and the LNGA), Kuehn will definitely be one to keep our eyes on as the week progresses.\r\n\r\n“I feel in control over the golf ball,” Kuehn said. “It's just a confidence thing, and I'm putting pretty well right now. I've been glad to be able to put myself in position to make some birdies and then being able to convert some of those.”\r\n\r\nSitting atop the leaderboard with Kuehn is Riley Smyth (Virginia). Smyth was bogey-free until the par-3 14th where she dropped a shot. Gaining it back on the par-4 17th, she is in prime position with 18-holes remaining before the event flips to match-play.\r\n\r\nBoth Kuehn and Smyth are North Carolina natives and playing in their first U.S. Women's Amateur. Rookies make up about 40% of the field, but do not let that be confused with poor play. Kuehn and Smyth are just two examples of elite players in the event that just so happen to be making their debut.\r\n\r\nThe second round, originally scheduled for Tuesday, will be postponed until Wednesday as weather from Isaias forcing a long rain delay Monday.\r\n\r\nWith the conclusion of play on Wednesday, the field will be cut to 64 and the format will switch over to match-play. Further schedule details will be released at a later time.",

    "articleText": "12 years separate the bookends of Jimmy Chestnut’s wins at the Golf Association of Michigan Championship.\r\n\r\nThe 38-year-old attorney from Royal Oak, Michigan rallied down the stretch as Ann Arbor native Tyler Copp faltered in Tuesday’s final round.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“I’ve won the Michigan Amateur and the GAM, and now the GAM again and to win three of the big GAM events is a big deal for me,” Chestnut told GAM’s, Greg Johnson. “It kicks me up a notch, I guess to another level in my mind, and to do it 12 years later is special.”\r\n\r\nAs the last golfer to win both the GAM and the Michigan Amateur in the same year (2008), Chestnut kept the draught going. Copp, a soon-to-be senior at Mercer (Georgia), took home the Michigan Amateur earlier this summer. Coming into the final round, Copp looked as though he would become the ninth golfer in the 99-year history of both events to sweep the pair in the same season.\r\n\r\nTaking a one-shot lead into the third and final round, Copp was cruising uneventfully through the front nine, tallying a bogey and birdie on Nos. 8 and 9 to close out the front for a 1-under 34. Unfortunately for Copp, three bogeys on the first four holes of the back nine gave Chestnut all the room he needed to snag the lead.\r\n\r\n Chestnut was one shot worse on the front side posting an even-par 35. As he began the day 4-shots back of Copp, the attorney began playing the role of both the prosecutor and the defendant. \r\n\r\n“I knew I was the last one to do it and when Tyler was a 9-under and I was at 5-under and four back, I started thinking it was his turn [to win]”, Chestnut said. “But then things changed, all of a sudden in a few holes we were tied and in entered my mind again that I could stop the double and still be the last guy to do it, which is kind of cool.”\r\n\r\nCopp did not go down without a little bit of drama as he had a tying 20-foot birdie putt come up one revolution short of the bottom of the cup on the 18th green.\r\n\r\n“I’m not going to be too hung up about it,” Copp said. “The Michigan Am was the one tournament I wanted to win this summer, so this was just icing on the cake, or could have been.”\r\n\r\nA familiar face finished third behind the pair. Michigan State’s James Piot lost the championship match to Copp at the Michigan Amateur. After bringing his “D-game” on Tuesday, Pilot carded a 71 to finish third at 5-under.\r\n\r\nWith over a decade past since his last big win, Chestnut was reassured that he was very much alive as he came down the stretch.\r\n\r\n“I got a break having an open shot on 18 to the green, and then I was able to two-putt with the nerves going,” he said. “That last three-footer was tough. I was lucky it found the bottom of the cup. It was really fun to be the mix, to be right there again with the nerves and it feels great to have pulled it off.”",

    "articleText": "Finally.\r\n\r\nAfter a month stretch of coming up on the short end, mid-am Nick Maccario comes through at the 56th Hornblower Amateur.\r\n\r\nThe golf gods swayed against Maccario at the Massachusetts Amateur, the New England Amateur, and the Francis Ouimet Memorial before giving him the nod this week.\r\n\r\n“Everybody has their week,” Maccario told AmateurGolf.com. “You just have to wait until it’s yours.”\r\n\r\nHappy he played well over the course of July, Maccario could not ignore the mental toll his close calls took on him.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“You need luck to win a golf tournament or at least a couple bounces,” Maccario said.“Not to say that you earn them or anything but there’s definitely a couple of times where I felt that my opponents got good breaks and I’d hit a couple of bad shots, so it’s a little bit of that luck factor.”\r\n\r\nHe found that luck on Tuesday at Plymouth Country Club. Heading into the second round of the 36-hole tournament, Maccario was six shots off the lead after posting an even-par 69. Battling harsh winds that were coming off the front edge of Hurricane Isaias, Maccario was 3-under on the day and was thinking he needed a par to at least tie round one leader Chris Francouer who was, at the time, 3-over on the day.\r\n\r\n“I felt pretty calm,” said Maccario. “The last shot I hit into 18 was a 90-yard shot, I couldn’t go at the pin I was coming out of the rough and it was downwind 30 miles per hour. I aimed just on the front edge and I just carried the bunker by a foot, it bounced up and got to the green about 20-feet [from the hole]. I was like ‘that’s the bounce I needed’... it was a good bounce that went my way.”\r\n\r\nJotting down a par to close things out, Maccario finally got the proverbial camel off his back. Francouer finished his round at 4-over (2-under for the tournament), finishing in a tie for second with Max Ferrari.\r\n\r\nWith the win, Maccario is looking forward to taking some much needed time off from competitive golf. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a more dominant stretch of golf this summer than the one Maccario put together.",

    "teaser": "The foundation of an outstanding home golf practice system starts underfoot and we've found the perfect mat from Wittek",
    "articleText": "We've all swung a golf club (and yes, taken divots out of our lawns) outside. These days, it's my always-swing tinkering 19-year-old son who can be found swinging a club outside most often, usually after watching the latest YouTube instruction video. \r\n\r\nThe isolation brought on by the pandemic means that all of us are spending more time at home, and several of my friends have come up with creative practice solutions -- usually involving an outdoor net.\r\n\r\nSo I decided it was time to up the ante on my home golf practice game, and my friends at Wittek Golf helped me get started. I've known Wittek for over 20 years, attending the PGA show in Florida and always marveling at their wide assortment of golf course equipment. Everything we take for granted when playing, from club cleaners, to range pickers, and everything in between, can be found on Wittek's website.\r\n\r\nIn a recent article on Covid-19 Best Practices for Golf Tournaments, I suggested personal rakes for carts, and Wittek had them available by the thousands. \r\n\r\nI'll quickly break down the two pieces of equipment I got from Wittek. \r\n\r\n<B>QUATTRO MAT</B>\r\n\r\nA lightbulb went off in my head when I laid out my new Quattro golf mat. 'Why did I wait so long to get one of these?'\r\n\r\nI've hit off of strips of artificial turf (they moved around a lot) and from mats that are rubber connected to a strip of turf (a little better, but lacking in the real-feel department). But the Quattro mat is the real deal. It feels like the perfect fairway. Not too soft but a little bit springy. \r\n\r\nThe Quattro is a professional grade product designed for the golf industry (courses, ranges, learning facilities, etc.) but affordable enough for home use. \r\n\r\nAs the name implies, there are four layers which make Quattro so nice to hit from. The grass is woven to an intermediate layer that allows it to withstand shot after shot. Beneath that is a dampening system -- kind of the \"secret sauce\" of the Quatro. Highly elastic polyurethane fibers absorb the impact of the club; an elastic vinyl mat underneath provides extra comfort when placed atop a hard surface.\r\n\r\nI can tell it's going to hold up well against the sun and rain -- I would recommend you take it inside during the winter if you aren't lucky enough to live in San Diego like I do. \r\n\r\n<B>7x7 PRACTICE NET</B>\r\n\r\nThe range mat, of course, should be coupled with a practice net, to produce your own outdoor (or indoor) golf studio. \r\n\r\nI received a 7x7 net from Wittek, which arrived at my doorstep in a box too small to believe. Inside were the components for an easy-to-install net system, complete with target, all inside a bag for easy storage.\r\n\r\nI immediately found a place in my small yard, where the mat could go on a flat brick surface, and the net could be securely staked to the lawn. Within minutes, I was hitting balls at the target and realizing that this is something I need to be doing every day. \r\n\r\n<B>HOW TO ORDER</B>\r\n\r\nWittek is offering AmateurGolf.com members a $100 discount on the Quattro mat - visit <a href=\"http://www.wittekgolf.com/amgolf\" target=\"_blank\">www.wittekgolf.com/amgolf</a> and enter promo code AMATEURGOLF for customers to receive Quattro mat for $299.99 plus shipping ($399.99 plus shipping originally). You can also order a mat/net bundle package or purchase the net separately.",

    "articleText": "Here's the problem with lightweight golf bags (sometimes referred to as \"Sunday\" bags).<br><br>\r\n\r\nThey are usually just smaller, floppy versions of the real thing, in some respects less user friendly than a regular golf bag.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFor example, I have a gorgeous leather bag I'll use sometimes, that fits a full 14 clubs. But with two huge pockets, it's actually harder to store and find stuff than my regular golf bag. And it really isn't much lighter.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSo when I play a short nine hole course, or am heading to the range, I usually just take clubs out of my regular bag and go out with it. But I was immediately intrigued when I found out that some San Diego golfers -- regulars at the fun \"Loma Club\" short course -- were in the process of designing a club perfect for those casual rounds. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIt's designed for the purpose, not dumbed down. That's the difference.<br><br>\r\n\r\nDubbed appropriately the \"Loma\" from Sunday Golf, it's shorter than a regular bag by a few inches (because whey not) and has a rugged rubber handle for easily picking it up instead of always strapping up.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt's waterproof, comes in several attractive colorways, and has the perfect pockets for your valuables, golf balls, cell phone, and a couple of cold beverages. (And the beverage pocket is front and center where it should be.)<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062446.jpg\"></div>\r\n\r\nOutside there is velcro so you can air out your glove and have it at the ready. The Loma has a stand too. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIt's perfect for throwing 4-8 clubs in, and heading to the range, the course, or anywhere in between. <br><br>\r\n\r\nLightweight bags are popular in golf-crazy countries like Japan and Korea, and I have no doubt that Sunday Golf is going to be successful.

At 14-years-old, Chien is no stranger to elite competition. Winning the AJGA’s KPMG Stacy Lewis Junior All-Star Invitational in both 2019, and 2020, Chien earned herself Symetra Tour starts with each win.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nFast forward to this week and it was business as usual for Chien. Kicking off the tournament with a 1-over 72, she was six-shots off the lead heading into Tuesday’s second round. Chien got hot early as she was 5-under through six holes. Cooling off, Chien finished the rest of her round at 1-over as she carded a 4-under 67 to climb the leaderboard.\r\n\r\nSleeping on a 1-shot lead, Chien kept the momentum going on Wednesday. Matching her front nine Tuesday score of 32, she had a more colorful back nine as the event came to a close. Extending her lead to six shots after the opening nine, Chien kept it steady as she traded three birdies and two bogeys for a 5-under 66 and an 8-under, 205 total.\r\n\r\nChien’s nearest competitor was 2019 U.S. Women’s Amateur Round of 64 finalist Madelyn Gamble.

The USGA elected to take Tuesday off to allow Hurricane Isaias to pass as the course took on nearly 3-inches of rain.\r\n\r\nStanford signee Rachel Heck snagged medalist honors following a hurricane-delayed second round at the U.S. Women’s Amateur.\r\n\r\n“I slept in super late,\" Heck told the USGA when asked how she spent the day off. \"I ate some food. I took another nap. I ate some more food. That's about how it went. It was pretty nice.” \r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe day off on Tuesday was a blessing in disguise for AG's No. 2 ranked player in the world and defending champion Gabriela Ruffels (Southern California).\r\n\r\n“I actually had two finals,\" Ruffels said. \"I'm taking two summer school classes. It worked out perfect that it was a day off because I could focus on my finals.\"\r\n\r\nWith her finals behind her, Ruffels made a run at medalist honors finishing tied for fifth at 1-under.\r\n\r\nHeck, who trailed red-hot Rachel Kuehn (Wake Forest) and Riley Smyth (Auburn) by a single shot following Monday’s first round had to wait an extra 24 hours to secure the top-seed and medalist honors at Woodmont Country Club.\r\n\r\nAs per usual with USGA championships, Woodmont was playing tough. However, when conditions are toughest, a simplistic approach is usually best.\r\n\r\n“It’s pretty tight, so we were focusing on hitting fairways, hitting greens, not trying to do anything crazy,\" said Heck. \"That's kind of been my game plan and it’s worked out well so far.”\r\n\r\nThe Memphis native built upon her opening 3-under 69 with a 1-under 71 as she was able to survive a turbulent 18.

Finishing the 36-hole stroke play portion at 4-under, Heck grabs the No. 1 overall seed as the event flips the page to match play.\r\n\r\nBoth Kuehn and Smyth carded rounds over par while still maintaining top-10 finishes, easily making match play.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of match play, the field was cut from 132 to 64 to set the bracket that will lead to a champion being crowned on Sunday in a 36-hole marathon. AG No. 1 Emilia Migliaccio (Wake Forest) flirted with medalist honors as well coming up two-shots short of Heck at 2-under.\r\n\r\nA record-tying 15-player playoff settled the final six spots of the 64-player bracket as 15 players came in on the 6-over cut line (2015; 16 for 10). Needing just two holes to sort out the qualifiers, the field is officially set for match play. The field will be cut in half to 32 on Thursday.\r\n\r\nPlayoff qualifiers: Kajal Mistry (Arkansas); Haylin Harris (Michigan State); Gurleen Kaur (Baylor); Therese Warner (Arizona); Auston Kim (Vanderbilt); Katherine Zhu (Pepperdine)",

Patterson Cup held by the Golf Association of Philadelphia. After picking up his first GAP major earlier this summer at the BMW Philadelphia Amateur Championship, Barbin becomes the first player to win both events since 1995.\r\n\r\n“To say you are going to win the Philly Amateur and Patterson Cup [in the same year], that’s ridiculous,” Barbin told GAP. “I came in second in stroke-play qualifying for the amateur at Stonewall in 2019 and that was kind of the point I realized I could actually play with these guys. I still can’t believe [I won]. I’m pretty stunned.”\r\n\r\nThe disbelief was justified. Osberg, who was looking to defend his 2019 title, missed a two-foot par putt on the fourth playoff hole to match Barbin’s aggregate score.\r\n\r\n“I’m really not that upset,” the 36-year-old mid-am said. “I feel like I hit a good putt. I don’t know what to say about it. I tapped down all the marks that were there… For that not to go in is devastating.”\r\n\r\nThanks to Hurricane Isaias the Patterson Cup was cut from 36 to 18 holes after Tuesday’s round was washed out. The mad-dash set up the three-way playoff between Barbin, Osberg, and Orlando who all finished at 3-under (67). Both Barbin and Osberg closed their rounds with bogeys, missing an opportunity to claim the title in regulation.\r\n\r\nAfter three playoff holes, Barbin and Osberg separated themselves from Orlando by two shots as the trio made their way to 18. Osberg found the fairway while Barbin bombed one into the first cut on the right side. First, to play out of the two, Osberg pulled a 9-iron left of the pin to 35-feet. Barbin answered with a pitching wedge over a tree from 157 yards. He sat 20-feet right of the hole, pin-high.\r\n\r\nLagging his birdie putt to a knee-knocking four-feet, Barbin was in for par.\r\n\r\n“That putt coming back was really hard. I can’t believe I made it,” said Barbin. “It’s tough to win that way. Jeff and Gregor were playing great. You want to beat the person to win, not have the guy make a mistake like that. It was a shame.”",

Devereux's brother, Max, won the Amateur back in 2015, giving Austin the opportunity to make history as the only set of brothers to win the NJSGA Amateur.\r\n\r\nPaired with NJSGA junior champion Dean Greyserman in the second-to-last group, the two duked it out for the title as overnight leaders Chris Dejohn and Brendan Hansen stumbled from their perch with 18 holes separating them from a win. Greyserman, who shot a tournament-low 67 in the first round, kept Devereux focused and on edge throughout the day.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“That 40-footer on top of Dean’s chip-in really got my confidence going,” Devereux told the NJSGA. “The biggest thing for me this week was putting. I had one three-putt all week. The funny thing is, putting was always my biggest weakness.”\r\n\r\nPosting a front nine 35 (-1), Devereux kept things rolling on the back nine as he birdied three of his first five holes after making the turn. Despite having issues with the short stick, Devereux had a gameplan and executed it to near perfection.\r\n\r\n“I said coming into today that I wanted to hit fairways and give myself some looks,” Devereux said.  “So today, I hit 12 fairways and 16 greens. My birdie looks were all inside 20 feet and I made a lot of 10-footers. After the front nine, I decided to get aggressive. You had to be aggressive here, especially where the pins were located.”\r\n\r\nFollowing a birdie on the par-3 14th, he logged a two-stroke lead over Greyserman. Gaining another shot over Greyserman after he bogeyed the par-5 15th, Devereux cruised to the 18th tee. Leaving a bit of drama, Devereux carded a bogey for a final round 69 and a 282 (-6) total.\r\n\r\n“I’ve taken my game to another level this summer,” said Devereux. “I’m much more confident.”\r\n\r\n2019 champion Mark Costanza came up short in his efforts to defend. He finished in solo third at 3-under (285). 54-hole co-leader Chris Dejohn tied for sixth at 1-under (287) alongside Ethan Ng. Fellow 54-hole leader Brendan Hansen carded a final round 74 to finish in a tie for fourth with Ryan Lee at 2-under (286).",

    "articleText": "By <a href=\"https://www.unionleader.com/sports/golf/her-wedding-postponed-by-pandemic-watt-finds-something-to-celebrate/article_333d4a6c-4cbc-501f-be4f-f13c0c269d31.html\" target=\"_blank\">Alex Hall New Hampshire Union Leader</a>\r\n\r\nTara Watt postponed her wedding this summer but celebrated another special moment Wednesday at Bretwood Golf Course.\r\n\r\nThe 37-year-old Derryfield Country Club member and Manchester resident won the New Hampshire Women’s Golf Association Amateur Championship for the second time, shooting a 7-over 223 over the 54-hole, stroke play tournament.\r\n\r\nWatt, who won the 2011 State Am at The Golf Club of New England in Stratham, planned to skip the tournament this year. She was supposed to get married on June 26 at Josiah’s Meetinghouse in Epping but rescheduled the wedding to next year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With an unexpected week’s worth of vacation time available, Watt entered the State Am on the second-to-last day of registration.\r\n\r\n“I was like, ‘What else am I going to do?’” Watt said. “We’re quarantined and can’t go anywhere, so might as well go play golf.”\r\n\r\nWatt, who had not played Bretwood since her high school career at Kennett of Conway, shot a 2-over 74 on Wednesday after posting a 76 on Monday and a 73 on Tuesday. She entered Wednesday tied with Atkinson Resort and CC member Barb Hecimovich for second place, as both were a stroke behind Intervale CC member Johnna Lorry.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHecimovich and Lorry, who both played alongside Watt on Wednesday, shared runner-up honors after both finished at 10-over 226. Lorry posted the lowest round of the tournament with her 1-under 71 on Monday. The runner-up finish was a career-best in the State Am for both Lorry, 36, and Hecimovich, 58.\r\n\r\nWatt said she adjusted her game and hit irons off every tee box because the 6,976-yard course was playing extremely short.\r\n\r\n“(Wednesday), I was just going to come out here and try to make 18 pars and I knew that would probably be good to stand out,” Watt said. “I didn’t do that but it still worked out.”\r\n\r\nWatt sunk a long-range putt to eagle No. 5, bogeyed No. 9 and No. 10, posted a double bogey on No. 15 and parred the rest of the course. The Southern New Hampshire University assistant women’s golf coach had a two-stroke lead at the turn and was 4-up after 14 holes.\r\n\r\nAfter Watt sunk her putt to make par on the final hole, she jumped in excitement and proclaimed that she was no longer a “one-and-done” winner.\r\n\r\n“I think that that eagle that I made on five was a huge momentum booster and I hit a driver and a wedge — that’s not normal to make an eagle,” Watt said. “But I made a bomb of a putt and that just kind of got me going and I was just real focused and just trying to hit fairways and greens and make some putts.”\r\n\r\nLorry, who is from Manchester and now lives in Bedford, said she hit good approach shots and made putts over the first two days of the tournament, which allowed her to lead after both rounds. Lorry, who said she plays golf only about 6-10 times a year, birdied on the third and fifth holes on Wednesday.\r\n\r\n“The bad shots were a little worse (Wednesday) and I had to scramble around to get to where I needed to be but being 6-over (Wednesday) is right where I usually play,” said Lorry, who has played in the State Am six times.\r\n\r\nHecimovich, of Hamilton, Mass., double bogeyed No. 3, which she said she knew would be hard to come back from.\r\n\r\nIntervale CC member and 15-year-old Eva Gonzales placed fourth with a 12-over 228. Abenaqui CC member and 16-time State Am champion Dana Harrity took fifth with a 13-over 229. Gonzales, a soon-to-be sophomore at Nashua High School North, shot a 74 and Harrity shot a 79 on Wednesday.",

    "articleText": "Kokomo, Indiana native Tim Miller began the final round of the Indiana Golf Association Senior Amateur Championship four shots off the lead. Two groups ahead of the overnight leader Steve Norris (Carmel, Indiana), Miller used home-course advantage to mount a comeback effort.\r\n\r\nShooting two-shots better than his age during Thursday’s first round, Miller was 1-over carding a 71. Coming back on Friday, Miller used six birdies and one bogey to post a 5-under 65, good for the low round of the tournament.\r\n\r\n“I’m 73 years old, so I played pretty well for me,” Miller told the IGA.  “I wasn’t too happy yesterday, but was proud of how I played today.\"\r\n\r\nAs a member of Kokomo Country Club in Kokomo, Indiana, Miller without a doubt used his local knowledge to carve five birdies into his scorecard.\r\n\r\n“It makes it a little easier playing at home,” Miller said.  “You know where the ball is supposed to be and it definitely helps with reading the greens a little better.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nMiller did just enough to keep a surging Bob Jacobs (Valparaiso, Indiana) at arms-length. Jacobs, in the final group, was tied with Miller to begin the final round. Besting his first-round score by five shots, Jacobs carded a 66 to finish at 3-under for the tournament and one shot back of Miller.\r\n\r\nThe win marks the third time Miller has hoisted the IGA senior amateur trophy. He was back-to-back titles in 2004 and 2005.\r\n\r\n“It’s very gratifying because I haven’t been playing in tournaments for a long time, so I was surprised,” said Miller.  “It’s a lot of fun playing competitively because I’ve known these guys for years.”\r\n\r\nJerry McMullen took home the super senior title with a 5-over 145, to win by two over Greg McCall.",

Gabriela Ruffels has been down in all three of her matches this week when standing on the ninth tee box. All three times she has mounted a comeback to keep her title defense alive.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I've been down in all of my matches, but No. 9 has been a big turning point for me,” Ruffels told the USGA. “If I can be close heading to the back nine, then I feel like I have an advantage.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nAdvancing farther than any defending champ since Danielle Kang in 2011, Ruffels took down the 2019 U.S. Girls’ Junior champion Lei Ye 2 up in the morning session and Teresa Toscano Borrero 4&2 in the afternoon session to punch her ticket to the Elite Eight.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe USC Trojan will face Golfweek/AmateurGolf.com’s No. 1 ranked woman Emilia Migliaccio in the quarterfinals.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18886/Emilia-Migliaccio?p=1\">Emilia Migliaccio</a> (Cary, N.C.)<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/rankings/18886.jpg\"></div></div>Boasting a 17-1-1 match play record in ranked events since 2017, Wake Forest’s Emilia Migliaccio came into the week as a favorite to claim her first USGA title.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSquaring off against 30-seed Amari Avery, Migliaccio made easy work to advance to the Round of 16 with a 3&2 win. However, Auburn’s Megan Schofill gave Migliaccio a run for her money, nearly giving her her second match play loss in over three years.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, it was best for Migliaccio that she put Avery away when she did. All square with Schofill on the 18th, Schofill nearly holed out from 150 yards, leading to a conceded birdie. With a 15-foot putt separating Migliaccio from a plane ride home or a chance to continue her run, she nailed the putt which was capitalized with a huge fist pump and a wave of momentum.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter a near-miss birdie from four feet on the 21st hole to win the match, Migliaccio rallied on the 22nd with yet another 15-foot putt to clinch her spot in the quarterfinals.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I'm just so happy,” said Migliaccio. “This is the first time I've ever been in extra holes in match play. I really want this thing, so I really fought for it.” Her marathon day will be rewarded with a 7:30 am ET match against the defending champ, Gabriela Ruffels.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/23730/Rose-Zhang?p=1\">Rose Zhang</a> (Irvine, Calif.)<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt has been almost three decades since the stroke-play medalist has also has won the U.S. Women’s Amateur.

I was 2 down at the turn. I just thought about doing whatever it takes to put the ball in play and give myself some chances.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nZhang faces 24-seed Kaleigh Telfer at 7:00 am ET on Saturday.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/23871/Kaleigh-Telfer?p=1\">Kaleigh Telfer</a> (South Africa)<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the second Auburn-Wake Forest match of the day (Migliaccio v Schofill), South African native Kaleigh Telfer helped the Tigers split bragging rights with the Demon Deacons.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBeating Emily Mahar in the Round of 32, Telfer was tasked with facing arguably the hottest amateur golfer on the planet in Rachel Kuehn. Coming off of back-to-back wins at the Women’s North & South as well as the LNGA Championship, Kuehn was maintaining her torrid pace at Woodmont Country Club.<br><br>\r\n\r\nTelfer won the match 2&1 by applying consistent pressure and jumping out to an early lead, not allowing Kuehn to gain any momentum.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Auburn senior will continue her quest against Rose Zhang in the Elite Eight.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/87745/Alyaa-Abdulghany\">Alyaa Abdulghany</a> (Newport Beach, Calif.)<br><br>\r\n\r\nMalaysian born Alyaa Abdulghany won her morning match 4&2 over Marissa Kirkwood en route to squaring off with 29-seed Ellie Slama. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe duo had a back and forth battle that had six lead changes. The last and most important lead change came on the 14th hole when Abdulghany tied the match with a par. All square through No. 16, Abdulghany iced the match with back-to-back birdies on holes Nos. 17 and 18 to advance.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAbdulghany will face 5-seed Riley Smyth for the first half of Saturday’s play.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/25614/Riley-Smyth?p=1\">Riley Smyth</a> (Cary, N.C.)<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Virginia Cavalier needed 39 holes to advance to Saturday.

Smyth knocked in a birdie on No. 16 and a par No. 17 to square the match heading to the 18th.

Tallying 13 birdies and five bogeys over his first 36-holes, Kovach tied the tournament’s 36-hole scoring record but could not keep his remarkable pace on Saturday, posting a 4-over 76.\r\n\r\nEnter Christopher Ferris.\r\n\r\nAfter an opening 70 and a second-round 74, the University of Missouri-St. Louis senior was even-par but far from Kovach. Plodding his way around the course, Ferris was on fire as the two made the turn. Closing the front nine out with four birdies on hole Nos. 5-8, he gained six shots on Kovach.\r\n\r\n“I just went out and played my game,\" Ferris told the MAGA. \"I knew the front 9 was my 9 and played the front in 6-under the first two days, if I played it in 3-under it would make it a match on the back 9.\"\r\n\r\nOut in 31, Ferris mellowed out on the back-nine needing to make up three shots as they stood on the 15th tee.

Applying the pressure when it mattered most, he capped off the summer with a remarkable final round 66.",

    "title": "U.S. Women’s Am: Gabi Ruffels has chance to go back-to-back",
    "teaser": "The table is set for history to be made at Woodmont CC on Sunday between a defending champ and a high school senior",
    "articleText": "There have been 12 winners in the 120-year history of the U.S. Women’s Amateur to win consecutive titles. Seven past champs have won two in a row and five have gone on to win a remarkable three consecutive Robert Cox Cups.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nGabriella Ruffels has an opportunity to add her name to that list.\r\n\r\nBeginning the day with a match against AmateurGolf.com’s No. 1 ranked player, Emilia Migliaccio, Ruffels found herself in a familiar position; losing while standing on the ninth tee. 2 down to Micgliaccio, Ruffels bounced back with wins on Nos. 9 and 10 to bring the match back to all-square. The stalemate lasted through the par-4 14th when Migliaccio won the par-5 15th with a birdie to go 1 up. Ruffels countered with a win on the par-3 16th.\r\n\r\nMatching each other with pars on No. 17, the highly anticipated match came down to the 18th. Both Ruffels and Migliaccio were roughly equidistant on their approach shots. Migliaccio threw her second shot to roughly 40-feet, leaving the door open for Ruffels. Capitalizing on the opportunity, Ruffels put her second inside 10-feet.\r\n\r\nNeeding just one more putt to fall to have a chance, Migliaccio, who had her flat stick rolling throughout match play, singed the cup from deep for a conceded par. Ruffels knocked her birdie in to knock out the Wake Forest senior.\r\n\r\nAfter a 15-minute break, Ruffels faced 2-seed Valery Plata (Michigan State) who defeated Florida’s Kennedy Swann 1 up to advance to the semifinals.\r\n\r\nWasting no time, Ruffels took a 1 up lead on the second hole. Plata countered on the par-5 3rd and took a 1 up lead of her own on the par-5 5th, her lone lead of the match. Plata’s lead was shortlived as Ruffels brought the match back to all square on the 6th. Settling in nicely, Ruffels led for the first time all week as she stood on the ninth tee 1 up.\r\n\r\nThough 12 holes, Ruffels built upon her slim lead with a win on 13 which was immediately countered on 14 by Plata. Parring the par-3 16th for the second time on Saturday, she accrued a 2 up lead with just two to play. Plata, with her back to the wall, could only muster a halve of the par-4 17th, giving Ruffels a 2 up victory and her second-straight championship match appearance.\r\n\r\n“Winning the U.S. Women’s Amateur for the second time would mean everything,” Ruffels told the USGA. “I know the list of names that have won it twice and I’d love to join them. It’s the biggest tournament in women’s amateur golf and it would be an honor.”\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the bracket was Ruffels’ Southern California teammate Alyaa Abdulghany.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAbdulghany faced University of Virginia’s Riley Smyth in the quarterfinals, winning 2&1 to take on 17-year-old Rose Zhang in the semis. Zhang, a 2019 U.S. Girls' Junior Amateur quarterfinalist, secured her semifinals spot by beating Auburn’s Kaleigh Telfer 2&1 in the morning session.\r\n\r\nA Stanford verbal commit, Zhang played spoiler to an all-USC championship match, never letting Abdulghany take the lead over the course of the match. Jumping out to a 1 up lead through No. 1, Zhang built a 3 up lead on Abdulghany as the two made the turn at Woodmont Country Club.\r\n\r\nAbdulghany attempted to rally with wins on holes Nos. 11 and 12 to bring Zhang’s lead to just 1 up. Unable to gain any more ground through holes Nos. 13-16, Zhang capped the match with a birdie on the par-4 17th.\r\n\r\nThe soon to be high school senior has a tall task ahead of her on Sunday as she will face the defending U.S. Women’s Amateur champion. \r\n\r\n“It's surreal because I watched her win the Women's Amateur last year, and it just makes me feel so honored to play with her since she's such an amazing player and an amazing person,\" Zhang said. \"I'm just going to go out there and have fun tomorrow and try my best.”\r\n\r\nAs for Ruffels, she will use last year as a reminder to stay in the moment.\r\n\r\n“I feel like it's the same, very similar to last year,\" Ruffels said. \"I’ll definitely draw on that experience. This championship is so crazy, with mixed emotions all the time. It’s like a roller coaster. I'm just so happy right now.”\r\n\r\nBy advancing to the championship match, both players gained exemptions into the 2021 U.S. Women's Open at Olympic Club.\r\n\r\nThe 36-hole championship match will be broadcasted on Golf Channel beginning at 1:00 pm ET.",

    "teaser": "One Virginia Tech senior keeps winning despite an uncertain future thanks to COVID-19",
    "articleText": "Virginia Tech’s Mark Lawrence Jr.’s game is more than what meets the eye. The tall, burly Hokie pounds it a mile like we’re accustomed to seeing every week on the PGA Tour, but his distance does not come at a cost to his short game.\r\n\r\nDefeating 17-year-old David Stanford of Vienna, Virginia, 3&2 to claim the 107th Virginia State Golf Association Amateur Championship, Lawrence put all facets of his game on display.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe 36-hole championship match ebbed and flowed throughout the day, but Lawrence showed complete control of his game, and subsequently his opponent.\r\n\r\nCommanding a 3 up lead after the morning 18, Lawrence kept applying pressure, winning the 19th hole to take a 4 up lead. On No. 2 (hole 20), Lawrence found himself in some trouble with a delicate chip that was needed to save par and halve the hole to maintain the 4 up advantage.\r\n\r\n“I typically get talked about as a guy who hits it pretty far,” Lawrence told the VSGA. “But I work on my short game more than I work on anything else, and actually, what I feel is the best part of my game is my chipping. I have a lot of confidence in my wedges around the green, just because I’ve worked at it a lot.”\r\n\r\nHaving his work pay off, Lawrence saw the chip shot fall in for the halve.\r\n\r\nWith his lead cut in half thanks to wins by Stanford on Nos. 7 and 8, Lawrence found himself needing to rely on his wedge play to maintain momentum on the driveable par-4 12th. Blasting his drive into a greenside bunker, Lawrence got up and down from 12-feet to take a 3 up lead with just six to play.\r\n\r\nAfter Stanford left a putt one revolution short on No. 14 to win the hole and cut Lawrence’s lead to 2 up with four to play, Lawrence closed out the marathon match with par halves on Nos. 15 and 16 to win his home state title.\r\n\r\nLawrence made elite company, becoming just the fourth player in state history to win both the Virginia Amateur and the State Open, a feat that has not happened in 35 years.\r\n\r\nWith the Atlantic Coast Conference dropping the hammer on the fall golf season due to COVID-19, Lawrence is still trying to figure out his immediate future.\r\n\r\n“There’s no Q School until 2021,” Lawrence said. “As of right now, the Tech team is planning on playing in the spring, so I plan to play in the spring. Hopefully, I can play well enough in the spring that I can earn status through the PGA Tour University. If not that, it’s going to be Q School next year, it’s just a matter of whether or not they have China, Latinoamerica, Canada, those tours, before Q School.

    "articleText": "In one of the closest matches in tournament history, 17-year-old <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/23730/Rose-Zhang?p=1\">Rose Zhang</a> upset defending champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18164/Gabriela-Ruffels?p=1\">Gabriela Ruffels</a> on the 38th hole of the U.S. Women’s Amateur thanks to a shocking 3-foot lip out off of Ruffels’ flat stick.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe two needed more than 36 holes to crown a champion. Ruffels was looking to defend her 2019 title and become just the 12th woman ever (and the fifth since World War II) to do so. As for Zhang, she was on the hunt to overcome a wrist injury that nearly kept her from playing in the event.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">38 holes.

Picking up another win on the par-4 12th with a par, Zhang settled in nicely before losing the 18th to Ruffels to take a 1 up advantage into the second 18-holes.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter a brief lunch break, Ruffels kept the momentum gained on the 18th to win holes Nos. 20 and 21, bringing the match back into her favor at 1 up. Undeterred, Zhang regained the lead with sequential birdies as the pendulum swung back and forth.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“Winning those two holes was huge,” Zhang told the USGA. “That gave me a chance to recover after losing the previous two holes. It allowed me to regain the momentum.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nWinning the par-4 7th (25th hole), Ruffles brought the match back to a stalemate as the duo kept throwing darts onto the undulating and lightning-quick greens at Woodmont Country Club. Trading wins on holes 30 and 31, the match lived up to its billing as they remained tied through regulation.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nDown the stretch, momentum looked as though it was set to sway back in favor of Ruffels. Having been in the final match last year, she stayed poised despite mental errors and/or poor shots on the final four holes of regulation. Keeping pressure on Zhang, the 2017 Girls’ Junior PGA champion handled the applied pressure well. Having made mistakes of her own and her father calling her off of putts just as she was about to roll them, Zhang kept her composure, not allowing her opponent to ruffle her feathers.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMatching each other shot for shot despite their respective mistakes, Zhang gave Ruffels a break on the 36th hole to send the match to a playoff.<br><br>\r\n\r\nZhang hit the shot of the championship after flaring her drive to the left and failing to get her second shot into the fairway. With just under 100 yards to the pin, Zhang put a wedge inside 2-feet from the thick left rough.<br><br>\r\n\r\nRuffels conventionally made the green and had a 4-foot tester to force a playoff on her own merit, but Zhang gave her the nod to pick it up. A move that would leave a weekend warrior scratching their head, the gesture was highly respectful of Ruffels.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith both players unable to capitalize on open doors, they went to the par-4 8th for their 37th hole of the match.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter halving the 37th, the match became the longest championship match since 2001 when Merideth Duncan took the title over Nicole Perrot on the 37th hole.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBoth players had their third shots on the par-4 9th inside of 5-feet. Zhang was given the nod to pick her ball up but, with the championship on the line, Zhang refused to give Ruffels the 3-footer to continue the match.<br><br>\r\n\r\nRuffels’ ball was halfway down the cup before rimming out, costing her the opportunity to win back-to-back titles. The putt reminds the most avid of golf fans of the putt that <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/8490/Steven-Fox-stuns-Michael-Weaver-to-win-U-S--Am\">gave Steven Fox the 2012 U.S. Men’s Amateur</a> when Michael Weaver had a 5-footer hit a pebble on the 37th hole.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“You can’t take any putt for granted out here,” Ruffles said. “These greens are crazy fast, and that did have a little break to it. I was playing it outside of the hole. I actually hit it on my line, but it was heartbreaking to see it horseshoe out.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nFor Zhang, the championship gives her validation.<br><br> \r\n\r\n“Winning the U.S. Women’s Amateur means the world to me,” said Zhang. “To have my name on the trophy with the best players of all-time is life-changing for me. It’s a dream come true.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nRuffels, by virtue of her win last year, will be in the spotlight in December at the U.S. Women’s Open at Champions Club in Houston, Texas. She also earned an exemption into next year’s U.S. Women’s Open at Olympic Club in 2021. Zhang, with the win, will join Ruffels at Olympic Club next summer.",

    "teaser": "Playing Bandon Dunes, the Southern Am champ fired 8-under 64 while Aman Gupta posted 29-35 for 64 at Bandon Trails",
    "articleText": "Wind, what wind?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22047/McClure-Meissner?p=1\">McClure Meissner</a> showed us he could go low in the wind less than a month ago <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/27206/Southern-Amateur--Meissner-comes-from-seven-back--wins-in-playoff\">at the Southern Amateur</a>. \r\n\r\nMeissner fired 66 in the last round at Maridoe in Dallas, when par was a good score on any hole. Today at Bandon Dunes, the SMU golfer got out before the heaviest Oregon coastal winds, and fired 8-under 64 on the day.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21354/Aman-Gupta?p=1\">Aman Gupta</a> of North Carolina also fired 64, at the par-71 Bandon Trails course, 7-under on the day.\r\n\r\nThose scores make the day sound easy, but at Bandon Dunes and Bandon Trails -- two of the five main courses at Bandon Dunes Resort -- it's easy to make bogeys, or worse, if things starting going sideways.\r\n\r\nThat's the nature of links golf - and Bandon Dunes is no replica of the British Isles most famous courses, it's the real deal.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nGorgeous wavy landscapes, sand dunes, tall grasses, and of course the Pacific Ocean make every hole at the resort a feast for the eyes. But wide-eyed smiles quickly turn upside down when you're hitting into a three club wind with the ocean on your left and virtually unplayable sand dunes on the right.\r\n\r\nSo sure, take advantage of the firm fairways, strike  crisp and accurate iron shots, and hole some putts -- any of the courses at Bandon Dunes will reward that kind of play. The par-5 holes are \"gettable\" and the occasional par-4 can be driven by the longest players.\r\n\r\nMeissner, just as he did in the last round of Maridoe, had a lot of things go right today. He birdied three of the first four holes, then added two more birdies for a 31. After a slow start to the back nine, Meissner followed a birdie on No. 14 with a bogey on the par-3 15th. And if you're going to take a bogey, that's a good place to do it -- the wind blows sideways off the Pacific as you guide your ball along the coast on the left, and a two story bunker on the right 'just says no' to par if you're in it.\r\n\r\nTurning back towards the clubhouse, Meissner birdied the last three to punctuate one of the lowest competitive rounds ever posted on the main Bandon Dunes course. \r\n\r\n“I got out there early and made some putts,” said Meissner. “I got off to a hot start and then hit it really well all day. I think I only missed one or two greens. I just gave myself good looks all day. We were fortunate that they moved up a couple [tee] boxes on a couple par threes. They could have made it extremely hard on those holes, but they were nice.”\r\n\r\nFor Gupta it was all about the front nine. Gupta teed off on the front nine of the Bandon Trails Course, and as the holes turn inland, he liked what he saw.\r\n\r\nHow's a 7-birdie 29 on the front nine? \r\n\r\n“I got a new putter on Friday, and it worked out pretty well,” said Gupta. “I think I had 11 putts on the front nine, so made it pretty easy on myself.”\r\n\r\nGupta slowed his birdie barrage down on the back, but still managed nine straight pars and a bogey-free 18 hole score of 64. It was the only bogey-free round of the day.\r\n\r\nBoth Gupta and Meissner credited taking advantage of their early tee times.\r\n\r\n“Anyone with a 7:30 [a.m.], 7 [a.m.] tee time definitely has an advantage this week because we didn't have to deal with hardly any wind until I want to say our 14th hole,” said Gupta. “So it was definitely a big advantage to go in the morning and make some birdies early before the wind started to pick up.”\r\n\r\nGupta is one of seven Oklahoma State golfers in the 2020 U.S. Amateur field. He's certainly set the mark for them, and the rest of the field.\r\n\r\n<b>NOTES</b>\r\n\r\n- <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/23427/David-Perkins?p=1\">David Perkins</a>, of East Peoria, Ill. and Illinois State shot a 68 at Bandon Trails to tie for the low score in the windy afternoon wave: “It was very challenging,” said Perkins. “It was about a three- to four-club wind. Probably four. But yeah, it made it challenging. It's fun, and knowing if you played well, you were going to gain a lot of ground.”\r\n\r\n- The defending champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/76098/Andy-Ogletree\">Andy Ogletree</a> shot a 74 at Bandon Trails, while last year's runner-up <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18421/John-Augenstein?p=1\">John Augenstein</a> had a 70 at Bandon Dunes. “Bogeyed three out of my last four coming in, so I played okay until then, just got to finish it off a little better”, said Ogletree. “Obviously playing [Bandon] Dunes [on Tuesday] in the afternoon, so it's going to be windy. But I've got to figure it out and just go post a good score and see what happens.”\r\n\r\n- Ogletree wasn't the only player to struggle coming in at Bandon Trails. The final four holes play straight into the strong north summer wind, and statistically played as the 1st, 5th, 2nd and 3rd hardest holes in relation to par.",

    "title": "August Madness? A statistical look at the U.S. Amateur bracket",
    "teaser": "David Tenneson takes a historical look at the data to see how match play seeding affects how far players advance",
    "articleText": "By David Tenneson<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe 120th iteration of the U.S. Amateur is being played at the Bandon Dunes Resort on the Oregon coast. First played in 1895, the USGA’s oldest championship has gone through a number of format changes.  Since 1979, this week-long event has featured a mix of stroke play and match play in order to crown a champion from a field of over 300 of the world’s best male amateur players.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe first stage of the event consists of two stroke play rounds, and there is typically a sudden-death playoff conducted on the morning of the third day to narrow the field into a match play bracket of exactly 64 players.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThere’s something uniquely thrilling about the idea of a bracketed tournament, for spectators as much as the competitors themselves. Survive and advance, as the saying goes.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nOne of the most scrutinized bracketed tournaments in sports is the NCAA Men’s basketball tournament held annually in March.  Over the years, statisticians have collected and analyzed historical results in different ways, looking for trends that not only explain what transpired but might also help predict future outcomes.  There are a few parallels between the basketball tournament and US Amateur match play brackets.  The obvious is the 64 seeds (excluding basketball’s play-in games), but there’s also the “specialness” quality that make both extremely exciting to follow as a spectator. Even so, there are very few diehard golf fans pouring over bracket scenarios the way basketball fans do in March.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStill, it is possible to apply some of the same statistical analysis methods used on college basketball data to draw some potentially relevant trends from past U.S. Amateur results.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Analyzing historical U.S. Amateur match play brackets</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062574.jpg\"></div></div>Focusing on match play data from 2000-2019, we can collect some interesting data points.  One place to start is by analyzing the first round (Round of 64) which has fixed match-ups.  Looking at this table sorted by success rate for the top 32 of 64 seeds, we see that while being highly seeded is important, there are still some single-digit seeds (9 and 4) which have successfully made it out of the first round less than half of the time.  Furthermore, even the lowest seeds have been successful more than a quarter of the time they tee it up against players who were either stroke play medalist or within a few shots of the medalist.  Part of this might be explained by the sheer randomness of golf, where a bounce off a tree limb or rock can make or break a hole.  There’s also the notion of players reacting to their or their opponent’s scores in the golf-equivalent of “clutchness,” which baseball statisticians have been trying to quantify in their sport for years.  An additional factor that makes match play unique is the fact that no matter how out of hand a hole gets, the player can lose no more than one hole at a time (as opposed to many strokes at a time in stroke play), which in some cases skews the normal risk/reward factor.<br><br>\r\n\r\nYou might be thinking the data looks different when organized as seeds 1-64 instead of the beloved basketball-style bracket regions (with four regions of 1-16 seeds). With that in mind, what follows is the same dataset with the U.S. Am seeds adjusted to the 1-16 numbering basketball fans are used to seeing.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062549.jpg\"></div></div>As seen with the “true” 64-slot seeding, the basketball style re-seeding shows how the #1 seed is successful in the first round approximately two-thirds of the time.  Also, the higher seeds have been more successful than the lower seeds, but at a rate that is essentially a coin-flip.  Note that the #2 seed has actually had a higher success rate than the #1 seed.  When filling out NCAA tournament brackets, many fans focus on the matchups that have more balanced (50%) success rates as areas for potential upsets, such as the infamous #5 vs #12 matchup.   Using this US Amateur data table, most of the matchups are close to balanced, giving statistical backing to the survive-and-advance mindset that is amplified in golf match play where advancing to the next round is not a given for any seed.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter examining the first round U.S. Amateur results, we can then expand this notion all the way to the Finals match. The tables below show the probability of advancing to each round for all 64 seeds. One area to focus on is the rounds in which each seed has struggled. For example, the #5 seed, which is one of the most successful in the first round, has struggled to pass beyond the Round of 32.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062546.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062547.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that in the last 20 U.S. Amateurs, only three times has any of the top 18 match play seeds gone on to win. But look at seeds 19-38, where 12 of the 20 past champions were seeded, comfortably in the middle of the bracket.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe #1 seed doesn't seem to provide any assurances after the first round (or maybe two) of match play, although the \"medalist jinx\" (losing in the first match) doesn't seem to be a thing either. The one #1 seed to win in the last 20 years was Ryan Moore, who also won the NCAA Championship, U.S. Public Links, Western, and Sahalee Players championships that year (2004).\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most surprising thing of all is the fact that the bottom seeds have yielded two champions.  In fact, the bottom four seeds have been more successful in the Finals match than the top four seeds, going 2/2 compared the 1/3 success rate of the top seeds. That is some excitement that college basketball fans are statistically likely to never see.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSo what does it all mean? Potentially nothing! We just don’t have enough data here to draw any meaningful conclusions.  Even with all match play results dating back to the format change in 1979 (or even further), the whole “past performance is no guarantee of future results” adage is still a thing.  We can see that there are some statistically-relevant takeaways from looking at the historical records, but no golfer is sitting over a 15 foot birdie putt to extend the match thinking “well I was 17% more likely to win this match based on my seeding, so this putt is 17% more likely to go in.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn reality, players that make the stroke play cut aren’t usually worried about their seeding and potential match play path.  In the end, all that matters is surviving and advancing until the Havemeyer Trophy is in hand.",

    "teaser": "In a tight race for medalist, Wilson Furr posts the round of the tournament to emerge from the pack at 11-under 132",
    "articleText": "When a course hosts its best players ever, the competitive course records are bound to fall. And anyone who has ever played Bandon Trails knows that there are plenty of birdies out there. But eleven of them? In the middle of a USGA championship? That's pretty amazing.\r\n\r\nWhatever <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/59313/Wilson-Furr\">Wilson Furr</a> saw in Bandon Trails, he liked. And his 62 is the new course record. Coming off a 2-under 70 at Bandon Dunes on Monday, the amazing 9-under round puts the University of Alabama senior from Mississippi at 11-under and in firm command of medalist honors and the No. 1 seed heading into Wednesday's match play round.\r\n\r\nFurr's 11-under total was one shot shy of the tournament record, posted by Hayden Wood in 2017 at Riviera Country Club. \r\n\r\n“I mean, until you told me all that, it didn’t really hit me, to be honest with you,” said Furr, who is competing in his eighth USGA championship and fourth U.S. Amateur. “We were just trying to run our game plan all day, and I just started hitting it close and a couple putts went in, and then kind of looked up and we were 7 under through 12. Like I said, it happened real fast, so I don’t know what to say really.”\r\n\r\nThe 62 matched the second-lowest 18-hole score in U.S. Amateur history. Californian Jeff Wilson shot 62 in 2011 at The Home Course in Dupont, Washington. (The lowest 18-hole U.S. Am score ever was a 60 by Billy Horschel.)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22165/James-Piot?p=1\">James Piot</a>, a rising senior at Michigan State, took the No. 2 seed, adding a 7-under 65 at Bandon Dunes to the 69 he posted Monday at Bandon Trails. His round included eagles on Nos. 9 and 13 (both par 5s)  and consecutive birdies on 17 and 18. It was the best round of the day on the course that will host all matches. \r\n\r\nPiot told the USGA that he took full advantage of the light winds and the luck of the draw he got with tee times.\r\n\r\n“At the beginning of the week I was sending off texts to all my buddies at home, saying, ‘You know what, [the] cut is going to be 6, 7 over,’” said Piot, who is playing in his first U.S. Amateur. “With this wind and how it was looking [during] practice rounds, [I told myself] I’m going to try to score the best I can this week, and I got a fortunate draw with the weather situation.\"\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18627/Benjamin-Shipp?p=1\">Ben Shipp</a>, of North Carolina State, finished birdie-eagle at Bandon Dunes for a 5-under 67 and earned the No. 3 seed at 8-under 135. Baylor University redshirt junior Travis McInroe, of Plano, Texas, followed a first-round 65 at Bandon Dunes with an even-par 71 at Bandon Trails to finish at 136, four strokes behind Furr. Shipp won the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/25841/Shipp-edges-Reband-in-South-Beach-International-Amateur-playoff\">2019 South Beach International Amateur</a> in a sudden-death playoff.\r\n\r\nFurr's record round at Bandon Trails comes just a day after the mark was set by <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21354/Aman-Gupta?p=1\">Aman Gupta</a> at 64 on Monday, and tied earlier Tuesday by <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/16411/Ollie-Osborne?p=1\">Charles Osborne</a>.\r\n\r\nGupta, one of 7 players in the field from Oklahoma State, fired 29 on the front nine at Bandon Trails yesterday on his way to a bogey free 64. Today, he struggled on the closing holes at Bandon Dunes, making bogey on Nos. 14, 16, and 17 but he did close with a birdie to round out a 1-over 73 for a two round total of 6-under 137. But it's all a bonus, considering Gupta was a last-minute addition to the field when a spot became available due to Ricky Castillo's WD.\r\n\r\nThat's tied with <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/28005/David-Ford?p=1\">David Ford</a> of North Carolina, a UNC Chapel Hill commit who earlier this summer won the AJGA Invitational, along with a PGA Tour exemption. \r\n\r\nAnd how's this for not letting a double bogey on the first hole ruin your day? \r\n\r\nYesterday, Ford made double on No. 1 at Bandon Trails. No big deal. He birdied five of the next eight holes to shoot 33 on the front nine, and posted 68 on the day.\r\n\r\nToday at Bandon Dunes, Ford again started with a double-bogey on the par-4 1st hole. He birdied Nos. 8 and 9 to get back to even on the day, then posted a bogey free 33 on the back nine to shoot 69 and tie Gupta at 6-under. Ford should be a tough match for anyone this week.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nSouthern Amateur champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22047/McClure-Meissner?p=1\">McClure Meissner</a> shot a 74 at Bandon Trails, ten shots higher than Monday at Bandon Dunes, but is still comfortably through to match play - tied with a group of four players at 5-under.\r\n\r\nIncluded in that group is past U.S. Mid-Amateur champion <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/4472/Scott-Harvey?p=1\">Scott Harvey</a> of North Carolina blistered his way through the front nine at Bandon Dunes to shoot 5-under 31 on his way to a 67 that puts him at 5-under 138 and easily ready for match play. \r\n\r\nHarvey will try to win a USGA championship for the second straight year at Bandon Dunes. Last year, he and his partner Todd Mitchell <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/23929/Harvey--Mitchell-finally-get-their-U-S--Amateur-Four-Ball-title\">won the U.S. Four-Ball Championship</a> on the Old Macdonald course.\r\n\r\nThere will be a new U.S. Amateur champion this year, as the defender <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/76098/Andy-Ogletree\">Andy Ogletree</a> will narrowly miss match play after rounds of 74-72 put him at 3 over par.\r\n\r\nTwo other U.S. Mid-Amateur champions are through to match play. Stewart Hagestad came home in 31 at Bandon Dunes for a 66, while Kevin O'Connell had a solid 70.\r\n\r\nOther notables making match play include last year's runner-up <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18421/John-Augenstein?p=1\">John Augenstein</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/64502/Tyler-Strafaci\">Tyler Strafaci</a>, winner of the North & South and Palmetto Amateurs earlier this summer.\r\n\r\n61 players finished stroke play qualifying at or below 1 over par. The final three spots will be determined by an 18-for-3 playoff that will tee off first thing Wednesday morning.\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Round 2 of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/USAmateur?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#USAmateur</a> stroke play featured some sizzling scores, including one of the lowest in the 120-year history of the championship! <a href=\"https://t.co/BUEWdMnPjf\">pic.twitter.com/BUEWdMnPjf</a></p>— USGA (@USGA) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USGA/status/1293546158812540928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 12, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n\r\n<B>TOURNAMENT NOTES (courtesy USGA) </B>\r\n\r\nThe average qualifying score in the U.S. Amateur over the last 15 years is 145.2.\r\n\r\nNotables to qualify for match play include 2019 U.S. Amateur runner-up John Augenstein, 2016 U.S. Mid-Amateur champion Stewart Hagestad, 2014 U.S. Mid-Amateur champion Scott Harvey, 2018 U.S. Junior Amateur champion Michael Thorbjornsen and 2017 U.S. Mid-Amateur champion Kevin O’Connell. Hagestad’s 6-under 66 at Bandon Dunes matched the second-lowest score of the day on the course.\r\n\r\nAndy Ogletree became the first defending champion to miss the cut since Stephen Fox in 2013 at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass. The 2020 Georgia Tech graduate shot 3-over 146.Three other reigning USGA champions also failed to qualify. U.S. Junior Amateur champion \r\n\r\nPreston Summerhays had a disastrous triple-bogey 8 on the 18th at Bandon Dunes to miss by two. U.S. Mid-Amateur champion Lukas Michel came up three strokes short, and U.S. Senior Amateur champion Bob Royak posted 157.\r\n\r\nIt also was a disappointing week for several top players in the World Amateur Golf Ranking® and notable champions. Cole Hammer, the 2019 McCormack Medal winner who was on the victorious 2019 USA Walker Cup Team, failed to advance along with fellow 2019 Walker Cup Team member John Pak, 2020 Western Amateur champion Pierceson Coody, two-time Asia-Pacific Amateur champion Yuxin Lin, and 2019 Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup Team member Alex Fitzpatrick, the younger brother of 2013 U.S. Amateur champion Matthew Fitzpatrick.\r\n\r\nScott Harvey, of Kernersville, N.C., certainly has an affinity for Bandon Dunes. The 2014 U.S. Mid-Amateur champion won last year’s U.S. Amateur Four-Ball title at the resort with partner Todd Mitchell (albeit on different courses) and then shot a 5-under 67 on Tuesday at Bandon Dunes to qualify for match play. This is Harvey’s first competitive event since last year’s U.S. Mid-Amateur at Colorado Golf Club in September.\r\n\r\nHarvey was one of five mid-amateurs (25 and older) to qualify for match play. He was joined by Hagestad, O’Connell, 2019 U.S. Mid-Amateur quarterfinalist Andres Schonbaum and Derek Busby.\r\n\r\nCharles “Ollie” Osborne, of Reno, Nev., had quite the turnaround, carding a 7-under 64 at Bandon Trails after an opening-round 77 at Bandon Dunes. The 64 included six consecutive birdies from No. 5 and 10 birdies in all. The Southern Methodist University rising junior advanced to match play at 2-under 141.\r\n\r\nOsborne was one of 14 players to improve his second-round score by 10 or more strokes. Cameron Sisk (79-66) got into the playoff, but the other 12 failed to advance. Thomas Hutchison, of San Jose, Calif., had the day’s biggest improvement at 14 shots (82-68).Four players who got into the field as alternates advanced: Gupta, Hugo Townsend, Carson Lundell and Jonathan Yaun.\r\n\r\nMason Anderson, of Mesa, Ariz., withdrew before Tuesday’s second round at Bandon Dunes with an undisclosed injury.

    "articleText": "By David Tenneson<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn 1979, the USGA changed the format for their oldest championship to be a mix of stroke play and match play.  Since that time there have only been two occasions (1985 and 2000) where the stroke play stage of the event ended with a clean cutline of exactly 64 golfers to move on to match play.  All other years there has been some kind of tie around that 64th position necessitating a playoff to bridge the two stages, and this year is no exception.<br><br>\r\n\r\n18 golfers played off for the final 3 match play spots on Wednesday morning. <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24203/Cameron-Sisk?p=1\">Cameron Sisk</a>, who had a heroic comeback with a 66 just to get into the playoff after opening with 79, birdied the 10th hole at Bandon Dunes, as did <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/17710/Evan-Katz?p=1\">Evan Katz</a>. Three players were eliminated with bogeys, and the other 13 went to the 11th hole to play for the final match play spot. <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/26618/Aaron-Du?p=1\">Aaron Du</a> birdied the difficult par 4 to claim the 64th and final spot into match play.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nOver the past 20 years, the average U.S. Amateur playoff has consisted of approximately 17 golfers competing for around 7 spots, which is not a quick process. Even when the playoff concludes after two holes – such as 2010 (16-for-6), 2013 (7-for-15), and 2017 (<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/19974/How-the-13-for-8-U-S--Amateur-Playoff-Was-Decided\">13-for-8</a>), and this year – this process can still take hours for all of the golfers to finish. One of the longest and most dramatic playoffs in recent memory was last year’s 27-for-3 fight that took nearly four hours for <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21477/Austin-Squires?p=1\">Austin Squires</a> to secure the 64th and final match play slot.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>How have playoff survivors fared in the championship?</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nOnce the field of 64 is finally set, the attention immediately turns to the first round of match play – the Round of 64. An interesting question is: does going through a (potentially marathon) playoff affect the chances of a player winning his match later that day?<br><br>\r\n\r\nUsing the same dataset from 2000-2019, below are the Round of 64 results for playoff survivors as well as results for the same seeds in years they were not filled by playoff survivors.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062567.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\nUsing these two tables, we’re able to get a sense of how playoff survivors tend to perform by comparing how successful a certain seed is when filled by a playoff survivor versus a player not subject to the playoff.  Focusing on seeds 52-61 where there are more than a few instances of each to compare, we see that generally speaking the playoff survivors perform better than their counterparts in the Round of 64.<br><br>\r\n\r\nPerhaps this increased success is due to the fact the playoff survivors are already somewhat warmed up or already had the adrenaline pumping with the morning playoff, or maybe it is simply worse for the higher-seeded opponents who have had to wait for the playoff to conclude before getting to face their opponent. Regardless, there is a notable difference in the first-round results for playoff vs non-playoff players.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNext, we can look how each of the groups performed in the rest of the match play rounds.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062568.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062569.jpg\"></div><br>\r\n\r\nWhat immediately jumps out when looking at these tables is the number of championships the playoff survivors have won. Not only have they won more championships, they have also had far more seeds with Finals appearances. Moreover, they have had more seeds make semifinal runs, quarterfinal runs, and final 16 runs.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThis data further solidifies the notion that as a group, the players who make it through the playoff are able to capitalize on that success with deeper match play runs than similarly seeded players who didn't have to go through the playoff. As an aside, note that the only 64th seeded player to make it to the quarterfinals in the last 20 years was Squires who followed up the grueling playoff with a magical run before losing to 17-year-old <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/26503/Cohen-Trolio?p=1\">Cohen Trolio</a>, the youngest recorded semifinalist in the tournament’s history.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Notable U.S. Amateur playoff participants</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nA number of recognizable names have appeared in these playoffs over the years.

There were only two other occasions – 2005 (19-for-17) and 2003 (14-for-12) – where an all-playoff survivor match-up was nearly realized.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>All eyes on...</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/26618/Aaron-Du?p=1\">Aaron Du</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/17710/Evan-Katz?p=1\">Evan Katz</a> and <a hef=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24203/Cameron-Sisk?p=1\">Cameron Sisk</a>.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe three survivors of the 18-for-3 playoff at Bandon Dunes, as would be expected, have difficult first-round matches.

Following a playoff that featured 18 players for the final three match-play spots, the Round of 64 was cut in half by day's end.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHere are the highlights from the first day of match play: <br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n<b>Ride the Wave</b> <br><br>\r\n\r\nPepperdine has quite the representation at Bandon Dunes. Sending seven to the event, three Waves advanced to match play. Clay Feagler won his match 4&3 over Eddy Lai, William Mouw continued his solid summer with a 3&2 win over Jordan Batchelor. The lone loss for the Waves on the day came at the hands of Notre Dame’s Davis Lamb who beat Joey Vrzich 2&1. Pepperdine was among three schools that had seven representatives at Bandon (Oklahoma State & Texas Tech). <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Upsets</b> <br><br>\r\n\r\nWith match play comes plenty of upsets. Most notably today was 62-seed Cameron Sisk defeating 3-seed Ben Shipp 5&4. Shipp, an NC State senior, led just once on the opening hole of the match. Sisk, a rising junior at Arizona State, took control of the match on the second hole and never looked back. Taking a 2 up advantage at the turn, Sisk won holes Nos. 12, 13, and 14 to ice the match. <br><br>\r\n\r\nOther notable upsets include 61-seed Sam Harned 4&3 over 4-seed Travis McInroe; (59) Noah Norton 3&2 over (6) David Ford; (48) Spencer Tibbetts 2&1 (17) Michael Brennan; (41) Tyler Strafaci 4&2 over (24) Kelly Chinn. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/bandon\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/Two-Man-Links-2021.jpg\"></a></div><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Mid-Ams</b> <br><br>\r\n\r\nFive mid-amateurs made it to Wednesday’s Round of 64. Derek Busby, Stewart Hagestad, Scott Harvey, Kevin O’Connell, and Andres Schonbaum tested their games against the young-bloods at the Dunes course. <br><br>\r\n\r\nHagestad will be on his own the rest of the way as the lone mid-am. After defeating Argentinian Abel Gallegos 1 up, Hagestad will face Spencer Tibbetts at 7:10 am PST as he continues to compete in his 20th USGA championship. <br><br>\r\n\r\n“I wasn't as nervous as I was in years past,\" Hagestad said. \"It's not in any way to say that I didn't care, but I was a little bit more comfortable with the position. Obviously, you hope you win, but if you play great and get beat, that's easier to take. I knew that I was playing some solid golf, and if I continued to execute, hopefully, we could make it close.” \r\n\r\nHagestad has every right to be comfortable.

In 2010 at Chambers Bay he toted the bag for Peter Uihlein as Uihlein brought the program’s fourth U.S. Amateur title back to Stillwater, Oklahoma. Doing the same for Viktor Hovland in 2018, Bratton began the week looping for OSU senior Austin Eckroat. Missing the cut for match play, Bratton began bagging for alternate Aman Gupta. <br><br>\r\n\r\nGupta got into the field when Florida’s Ricky Castillo withdrew citing an injury. Taking advantage of the opportunity, Gupta fired a 6-under 137 to secure a T-5 finish and a spot in match play. As the 5-seed, Gupta took on 60-seed Van Holmgren, advancing 3&2 into the Round of 32. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>The 16th</b> <br> <br>\r\n\r\nThe risk/reward 16th played a pivotal role in multiple matches Wednesday. The driveable par-4 lays down-wind with the pacific lining the right side and pot bunkers guarding the front.\r\n\r\nJonathan Yuan took a 2 up lead on the 16th, putting his tee-shot to 15-feet for a two-putt birdie before icing the match on the 17th for a 3&1 win over Davis Thompson.\r\n\r\nTexas A&M's Sam Bennett clinched his spot in the Round of 32 after getting up-and-down from a pot bunker for a match-ending birdie against Andy Lopez.\r\n\r\nThe 16th left former 1992 U.S. Amateur champion Justin Leonard enamored as he called it \"the star of the show\" on NBC's coverage.\r\n\r\nSurely as the field crunches down, the 16th will be able to steal more of the spotlight. <br> <br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n<b>Top Dog</b> <br><br>\r\n\r\nNo. 1 seeds have not had the best record at the U.S. Amateur since 1992. 14 medalists have had a first-round exit with only two players able to sweep both halves of the event. Alabama’s Wilson Furr was able to survive the Round of 64 with a 6&4 victory over China’s Aaron Du. <br><br>\r\n\r\n“This is the most exciting thing that’s happened to me in my golf career,\" Du said after making the field of 64.\r\n\r\nDu snuck into the match-play portion by the skin of his teeth, sinking a 10-footer for birdie on No. 11 for the third and final spot, making for a long day for the Cal Golden Bear.\r\n\r\nFurr and the remaining 31 other players will look to continue their quest for the Havemeyer Trophy Thursday as the field will be trimmed from 32 to eight. <br><br>\r\n\r\nTelevision coverage of the event begins at 6:00 pm EST on NBC's free streaming service Peacock before flipping over to Golf Channel at 7:00 pm EST to close out Thursday's festivities.",

Finally gaining ground with his first win of the day coming on No. 11, Tibbits trimmed Hagestad’s lead to just 1 up with wins on Nos. 13 and 14.

Turning the tide, Furr won three of four holes (10, 12, 13) to give him his first lead of the day. Furr carried the 1 up lead through the 17th. That was when Ott clutched up on the 18th, making birdie on the 560-yard par-5 to force extra holes.<br><br>\r\n\r\nPlaying the 375-yard par-4 1st, Furr folded as he jotted a double-bogey six on his card to Ott’s par.

But then Strafaci found his game. Carding wins on five of the next seven holes and only losing the par-3 15th to the Razorback, Strafaci played the final eight holes at 4-under which included an eagle on the par-5 13th that gave him the lead.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStrafaci clinched a spot into the afternoon’s Sweet 16 on the 17th hole, winning the hole for a 2 up victory.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>The Power of Thor</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18850/Michael-Thorbjornsen?p=1\">Michael Thorbjornsen</a> must really like the West Coast.

In the Round of 32, Strafaci squared up against <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/16919/Julian-Perico?p=1\">Julian Perico</a>, defeating him 2&1, setting up a match with Perico’s soon-to-be roommate <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18255/Agustin-Segundo-Oliva-Pinto?p=1\">Segundo Oliva Pinto</a>.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHolding no more than a 2 up lead for 11 holes throughout the day, Oliva Pinto fought back with wins on Nos. 13 and 16 to get the match back to all square. With the match tied on the 18th, Oliva Pinto hit his approach into a greenside bunker, while Strafaci was just off the front of the green. As sometimes happens at Bandon, the wind had blown much of the sand in the bunker, so that Oliva Pinto's ball was on an exposed spot where sand had been displaced.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt was then that Oliva Pinto's caddy stepped into the bunker and reached down to the sand, appearing to brush the surface multiple times with his hand. A rules official was called over, and though the caddy denied that he was testing the sand, television replays clearly showed him doing so.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe penalty for this is loss of hole, so just like that the match was over and Strafaci was declared the winner.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It all came down to the 18th hole.<br><br>And then this happened. <br><br>The outcome?

He’s a great kid and he played great, we both played great. And for that to happen I just feel really bad for him.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen asked how he would move forward, Strafaci replied “I’m going to make it [the win] worth something. I’m going to go out tomorrow and try to win my match and keep moving.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nOlvia Pinto was preparing for the shot, unaware of his caddy’s actions.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“At this point, it doesn’t really matter,” Oliva Pinto said. “What happened happened. He can say anything, but it won’t change what happened.”<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I’ll definitely try to use the positives I learned this week.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nStrafaci will face the red-hot mid-am Stewart Hagestad as he tries to put Thursday’s finish behind him.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>A Run at History</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/6046/Stewart-Hagestad?p=1\">Stewart Hagestad</a>, the 2016 U.S. Mid-Am champion, is playing for more than a win at Bandon Dunes.

With qualifying non-existent this year due to COVID-19, the USGA created exemptions for the top seven amateurs in the WAGR rankings. So far, Hagestad’s efforts are looking good. Claiming a 4&3 victory over <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22608/Harrison-Ott?p=1\">Harrison Ott</a> who took out this year’s medalist <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/59313/Wilson-Furr\">Wilson Furr</a> in Thursday’s morning session, Hagestad continues his quest to become just the second player to win both the U.S. Mid-Am and U.S. Amateur in his career. <br><br>\r\n\r\nJay Sigel is the only player to do so, winning the Amateur in 1982 and 1983 and the Mid-Am in 1983, ‘85, and ‘87. Hagestad also has an opportunity to become the first mid-am to win the U.S. Amateur since John Harris did so at 43-years-old in 1993.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Ollie, not Ozzy</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nSMU’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/16411/Ollie-Osborne?p=1\">Charles ‘Ollie’ Osborne</a> is seeking to join the likes of <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/5358/Bryson-DeChambeau?p=1\">Bryson DeChambeau</a> as the fifth Mustang to win the U.S. Amateur.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHalving just once and dropping No. 7 to <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/25183/Carson-Lundell?p=1\">Carson Lundell</a>, Osborne took a 6 up lead as the pair made the turn. Far from a road to nowhere, Osborne kept applying pressure. Halving the 10th and losing the 11th, Osborne sealed the deal with a birdie on the 138 par-3 12th and a par on the par-5 13th, punching his ticket to face Arizona State’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24203/Cameron-Sisk?p=1\">Cameron Sisk</a> Friday afternoon.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Sisk-ty Six</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24203/Cameron-Sisk?p=1\">Cameron Sisk</a> is living right.

In search of becoming the third Cowboy to win the U.S. Amateur with Bratton on the bag, Gupta took down Texas A&M’s <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/136069/sam-bennett\">Sam Bennett</a>. Bennett could not buy a putt in the windy conditions on the back nine, burning edges on four putts inside 10-feet. Never looking comfortable over the ball while trying to calculate both break and wind, the most painful lip-out came on the 14th to keep the match at 3 up in favor of Gupta.

Getting back to his winning ways, Thorbjornsen built his lead to 4 up. Attempting a comeback, Fernandez de Oliviera grabbed wins on Nos. 12 and 15 thanks to clutch putts. However, it was Thorbjornsen who got the win on No. 16 after flirting with the coastline off the tee for a two-putt par and a Friday tee time with Gupta.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b> Slow & Steady </b> <br><br>\r\n\r\nLSU's <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/44821/Philip-Barbaree\">Philip Barbaree</a> and Pepperdine's <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/24757/William-Mouw?p=1\">William Mouw</a> rounded out the day as the last match to close out the eventful day at Bandon. <br><br>\r\n\r\nPutting lights out all week, Barbaree took momentum early from Mouw as he grabbed a 2 up lead through No. 9. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Pepperdine Wave was not going to go down without a fight as Mouw rallied with par wins on Nos. 11 and 12 to bring the match back to all square. Just as it looked as though Mouw was going to complete the comeback to continue his solid summer, Barbaree shut the door winning three of the final five holes thanks to some creative shot-making but despite having to make a difficult bogey putt on 17 to close it out.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBarbaree faces <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22269/Matthew-Sharpstene?p=1\">Matthew Sharpstene</a> in the quarterfinals Friday afternoon.<br> <br>\r\n\r\n<b> Sharp as a Knife</b> <br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22269/Matthew-Sharpstene?p=1\">Matthew Sharpstene</a> was a quiet assassin on Thursday.

The Redmond, Washington native posted rounds of 65-69-73 for a 9-under 207 and a 1-shot victory.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nTaking a 5-shot lead into the third and final round, Kato immediately double-bogeyed the first while his playing partner and closest competitor, Boise State’s Brian Humphreys. Through two holes, Kato allowed a three-shot swing to cut his lead down to just two.\r\n\r\nMaking the turn three shots better than Kato, Humphreys was hot on his tail, making up the 5-shots from when the duo began the day as they stood on the 16th tee. Humphrey wasn’t alone. Zachary Stocker, who began Thursday eight shots off the lead, was also tied with Humphreys and Kato but was one group ahead of the leaders.\r\n\r\nStocker, who also doubled the first, carded two eagles in his effort to shoot a 5-under 67 but his round fell just short as he finished two shots back of Kato.\r\n\r\n“Today was a really hard day,” Kato told the WGA. “Brian Humphreys played unbelievable, and I just gutted my butt off the last four holes and just found a way to hit some shots down the stretch. It was really cool to be there. It has been a while since I’ve been in that spot, and to feel the nerves was really cool.”\r\n\r\nKato and Stocker dueled down the stretch with Kato’s birdie on No. 16 being the difference-maker. Needing an eagle on the par-5 18th to give Kato a final run, Stocker was unable to apply the pressure, matching Kato with birdies to close the tournament.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what it is like to have his name on the same trophy as Freddie Couples and current hot-hand on the PGA Tour Joel Dahmen, Kato said, “It feels awesome. Honestly, it hasn’t sunk in yet. It is such an honor to be on that trophy with all those names, and something I’ll cherish forever.”",

    "articleText": "Incoming Columbia freshman Allison Paik defeated her soon to be teammate Anne Walsh for the 117th Massachusetts Amateur Championship at The Country Club.\r\n\r\n“Going into today we were hoping for an all-Columbia final and we got it,” Paik told Mass Golf. “I've grown up playing with Anne, starting with U.S. Kids. We were so little growing up playing so many tournaments with her, playing against her. But we're really good friends, and I'm really happy to be going to Columbia with her.”\r\n\r\nPaik made quick work of all of her opponents, never having to use Nos. 16, 17, or 18 to secure her wins. Playing four matches, Paik only needed 56 holes, winning 25 of them outright.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“I think the first four holes on this course really fit my eye,” said Paik. “There are two really gettable par fives that I can make birdie. And then the second hole, I actually eagled it in one of my matches. I think getting off to a fast start is really important.”\r\n\r\nFor Walsh, she was again the bridesmaid, making it to the championship match last year but, just like this year, was unable to come through for the win. As a consolation, Walsh was able to come through at the Ouimet Memorial and was runner-up at the Massachusetts Girls’ Junior Amateur.\r\n\r\nFriday morning saw the future teammates win their semifinal matches to set up the all-Columbia final. Walsh needed 21 holes to defeat Rebecca Skoler while Paik cruised to a 4&3 win over Mary Mulcahy.\r\n\r\nAs the 8-seed, Paik surpassed her semifinal finish in 2016. Hitting eight greens in regulation, and seven of 10 fairways in regulation, the 12 hole match proved to be the biggest margin of victory in the past decade at the Massachusetts Women’s Amateur.\r\n\r\nBoth Paik and Walsh will have to wait to begin their collegiate golf careers as COVID-19 has put a halt on all Ivy League sports through at least the fall.",

    "articleText": "The final four are set at Bandon Dunes.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWho is going all the way is anyone's guess. As we have seen throughout the week, momentum shifts quickly during windy afternoon matches, when players have to factor wind on even the shortest of putts. <br><br>\r\n\r\nOne player who has done a great job of managing the wind is Ollie Osborne of Reno, Nevada. Osborne was 4-up against Cameron Sisk before losing four-straight holes on the back nine. Facing a huge shift in momentum, Osborne flighted down an iron on the windswept par-3 15th to the back of the green and two-putted to win the hole and take back control of the match. He will play Matthew Sharpstene in the semifinals.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nTyler Strafaci, the recent North & South Amateur champion, is in the process of chasing his grandfather's golf legacy. Should he win here, the Georgia Tech product will join his grandfather Frank as not only a North & South champion but a USGA Champion as well (Frank won the Public Links). \r\n\r\n<br><br>After a strange ruling caused by a caddie touching the sand on 18 gave Strafaci a win yesterday, he took no chances today against mid-am standout Stewart Hagestad. After Hagestad left his par putt \"just short\" on No. 17 to go 1-down, Strafaci's match again went to No. 18. But this time he knocked it on the par-5 in two and two putted for birdie. To his credit, Hagestad made one of the best runs by a mid-am in recent U.S. Amateur history.

    "teaser": "UC Davis claims its second NCGA Amateur title since 2018",
    "articleText": "Playing competitively for the fifth consecutive week, UC Davis sophomore Lucas Carper used his youthfulness to his advantage, having enough in the tank to bring himself to victory.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAs the 26-seed, Carper battled his way to the finals, never needing the 18th hole to complete his wins. Winning his matches 2&1, 4&3, 3&2, and 4&2, Carper was set to match up against 12-seed Weston Payne in a 36-hole marathon on Friday at Spyglass Hill.\r\n\r\nAlthough fatigued from five weeks of intense play and rigorous match play on a tough course this week, Carper never trailed in any of his matches.\r\n\r\n“It’s a long, long grind out here,” Carper told the NCGA. “It was really rough at times.”\r\n\r\nEven though he may have thought it was tough, Carper didn’t show it. In the championship match, he quickly amassed a 4 up lead as the duo made the quarter-post. In fact, Carper won seven of the first 10-holes while dropping one in favor of Payne, good for a 6 up lead through 10 holes of play.\r\n\r\nRather than lose focus and play lackadaisical, the big lead helped Carper stay focused, saying, “The start and early lead kept me going for the second round,” and “I had a lot of confidence entering the afternoon round.”\r\n\r\nAfter 26 holes, Payne finally chipped away enough to make a comeback seem doable. Carper was 3 up with 10 to play, which despite the amount of energy Payne had to expend to cut the lead in half, a 3 up lead is never safe.\r\n\r\nRegaining a 4 up lead on the par-3 12th, Carper teed it up on his least favorite hole; the par-4 13th.\r\n\r\n“The 13th had caused me problems all week,” Carper said. “I was thankful to get that par at that moment.”\r\n\r\nCarper was able to seal the championship on the par-3 15th with a 4-iron from 229 that was close enough to be conceded. Payne dumped his tee shot into the water, essentially ending the match.\r\n\r\n“This is my biggest win ever,” said a tearful Carper. “It hasn’t sunk in yet. It’s unreal to win and have my mom and dad out there with me. It means so much.”\r\n\r\nCarper became the second UC Davis player to claim the championship as Thomas Hutchinson won it back in 2018.\r\n\r\nIn the senior bracket, Rich Petit and Tom Ansbro needed extra holes to crown a champion. \r\n\r\nPetit fell 3 down early in the 18-hole match before clawing his way back to drawing it all square on the 17th before halving the 18th to force extra holes.\r\n\r\nTaking the win on the second playoff hole, Petit took home his first NCGA title.",

    "articleText": "The 48th Junior Southern Championship hosted by Blessings Golf Club in Johnson, Arkansas was the of Thomas ‘Tommy’ Morrison’s first win in quite a while.\r\n\r\nThe 6-foot-8 15-year-old phenom owned the course as the only competitor in the field to post all three rounds under par (67-69-68). Morrison, who had a three-shot lead heading into the final round, cruised to a four-shot victory on Friday.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“I was in the same situation last year, leading the first two rounds,” Morrison said. “It’s been a while since I won a tournament, so it feels really good to pull off a win.”\r\n\r\nMorrison’s closest competitor was Duluth, Georgia’s Carter Loflin. Loflin was extraordinary most of the week, only having a slow start during the first round. With four bogeys to three birdies on Wednesday, Loflin tallied a 1-over 73, which could have been the difference maker to tie Morrison on Friday.\r\n\r\nQuickly turning it around on Thursday, Loflin flirted with being on #59Watch through No. 8. Going 6-under through eight, Loflin stumbled with a double-bogey to close out the front nine for a 32. Regaining the two dropped shots with birdies on Nos. 10 and 11, Loflin cooled off going even the rest of the way.\r\n\r\nIn Friday’s final round the duo was paired together with Loflin needing to make up three shots.\r\n\r\nGaining a shot on the front nine, Loflin was unable to catch Morrison, posting a 69 to Morrison’s 68.\r\n\r\nWith the win, Morrison helped the state of Texas claim the State Team competition. Hudson Weibel, Dallas (143), Jaivir Pande, Houston (144), and Sebastian Moss, Pearland (144) were accompanied by Morrison’s 136 through the first 36 holes.\r\n\r\nWe’ll continue to see plenty of Morrison’s game over the next few seasons. The high school sophomore picked up two years of AJGA exemptions, an exemption into the 2021 Northeast Amateur, the 2021 Southern Amateur, and more with the victory.\r\n\r\n",

    "teaser": "Two father/son combos will go at it Sunday, with Tyler Strafaci and dad chasing his grandfather Frank's legacy",
    "articleText": "As a golfer, you dream of playing links golf on a sunny day with light winds like the four semifinalists got to play in today. But as a spectator, after watching U.S. Amateur players get blown around the course, it's a bit of a letdown. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBut don't worry, calm days don't usually stay around for long on the Oregon Coast, and over the 36-hole final on Sunday we are certain to see mother nature play more of a part.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThat's not to say that it wasn't fun watching today. With no commercials, and just two matches going, the continuity of the TV coverage is amazing. There were no major rules infractions like we saw with the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/27304/U-S--Amateur--18th-hole-penalty-shocker-helps-set-Elite-Eight\">local caddie on Thursday touching the sand on No. 18 leading to a loss of hole</a>, but we did see one small penalty assessed early in one of the matches. That happened when Matthew Sharpstene was deemed to have caused his ball to move during his halted backswing on No. 5, costing him a stroke.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the first matchup today, Tyler Strafaci started out playing conservatively and waiting for his opponent Aman Gupta to make mistakes. Often laying back off the tee, Strafaci picked his spots and won thre of the first five holes, and made the turn 3-up over Gupta. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nGupta seemed to take the bait on holes like No. 5, where Strafaci hit his approach to the center of green first, from a position well back of Gupta's perfect drive to the throat of the narrow fairway. Faced with just 143 yards to a left pin, the Oklahoma State golfer pulled his short iron left and gave up the hole to a routine par.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOver the last few days, the 10th hole has been a very reachable par-4, but with so much crosswind most players wound up left of the green. Not so today, and Strafaci took the opportunity to drive the green, two putting for par and another win. 4-up seems to be the point of no return in an 18-hole match, and after missing a short par putt for a win on the difficult 11th hole, it looked like game over for Gupta.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/bandon\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/Two-Man-Links-2021.jpg\"></a></div><br>\r\n\r\nBut Gupta fought back with a huge par saving putt on No. 12, an amazing up and down from the huge swale in front of the 13th green to take the match back to 3-down, and a win at No. 15 with a double bogey (see below, it was ugly but effective).<br><br>\r\n\r\nThen Gupta hit the shot of the day. With his opponent safely on the green 15-feet away for birdie on No. 16, Gupta hit a long blast from a pot bunker short of the green that barely cleared a greenside bunker, before settling to 7 feet. He made it, narrowing the margin to one hole with two left. After being 4-down through 12 holes, the gritty player from North Carolina who only barely got into the field as a first alternate was looking to make his trip to Bandon Dunes worthwhile.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOn to No. 17, and Gupta won with a par when Strafaci missed an 8-foot par putt after finding the pot bunker off the tee. For the third-straight match, Tyler Strafaci would stand on the 18th tee all square. When Gupta missed wide right (almost in the hazard) Strafaci over corrected and pull hooked his drive into the deep heather on the left.<br><br>\r\n\r\nNerves are tough, being tired with nerves is even tougher. And Strafaci was starting to show signs of wearing down physically and mentally.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut coming making up such a deficit finally took its toll on Gupta, who took three shots to extricate himself from the fairway bunker on No. 18, leading to double bogey. Once again Strafaci (who made a nice chip to the green in three for an easy par) was faced with a whirlwind of emotions coming off the 18th green a somewhat shaken victor. \"I started having some negative self talk,\" he admitted in a post-round interview, crediting his father's upbeat coaching with helping him stay positive at No 18,  Looking to the Sunday final, Strafaci said, \"I've got to putt better tomorrow.\" \r\n\r\nThe Matthew Sharpstene vs. Ollie Osborne match was much closer, at least on the front nine. The players were even through eight holes. <br><br>\r\n\r\nBut then momentum shifted quickly, as Sharpstene lost confidence in the most important club in match play. He four putted the par-5 9th for bogey to go 1-down, made a nice birdie save from 4-feet on No. 11 but again three putted No. 11 to go 2-down. But there was no back-down in Sharpstene -- hitting second on the par-3 12th he stuffed his tee shot to 10 feet and mustered up a great stroke to make birdie and get back to 1-down.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOsborne put things almost out of reach with back-to-back birdies on Nos. 13 and 14. Despite Osborne taking an unplayable lie from the gorse on No. 15 (leading to double-bogey), Sharpstene couldn't capitalize -- missing a short putt for bogey and win. The match ended on No. 16 when Osborne won with a par, taking the match 4-and-2.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<B>SATURDAY NOTES</B><br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Featured Hole: No. 15</b><br>\r\nHave you played Bandon Dunes? If you have you know that it's one of the most scenic and challenging holes anywhere. Even without wind, we could all feel the pain of Tyler Strafaci as he missed his tee shot well short and right of the green, with a mountain to climb to get back on board. After blading his wedge over and leaving the next shot short, Strafaci had scored a triple, on a hole where a bogey would have won him the match. Gupta had his own problems, letting pitch from over the green roll right back to his feet, but he managed to compose himself and take the hole with a double-bogey.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut wait, there's more...<br><br>\r\nIn the Sharpstene/Osborne match, Osborne had to take an unplayable lie from the gorse over the green. Sharpstene missed a short bogey putt to win the hole, meaning the final four players in the U.S. Amateur played a par three hole in 9-over par. I challenge the golf historians to find a hole that saw that kind of scoring during U.S. Amateur semifinals.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>TV Coverage Scores Again</b><br>\r\nGolf Channel does a great job providing back stories and interviews - today we again heard from course architect David McLay Kidd and a live interview with owner and links golf visionary Mike Keiser, who said he \"always looked at the U.S. Amateur as a major.\" <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Dads on the bag:</b><br>\r\n It's not uncommon to see a father caddying for his son, but today was very special in that department with three of the four players having their dads loop for them. The fourth player, Aman Gupta, took his college coach Alan Brtatton of Oklahoma State -- Bratton has been on the bag of two previous champs -- Peter Uihlein at Chambers Bay in 2010 and Viktor Hovland in 2018 at Pebble Beach. But the sentimental favorite is Tyler Strafaci's dad Frank, whose own father won the USGA Public Links and back-to-back North & South Amateurs in the 1930s. Watching Frank wince after a missed putt? Priceless.",

    "articleText": "“Oh please be good!”<br><br>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/64502/Tyler-Strafaci\">Tyler Strafaci</a> begged to his ball as it flew from his four-iron toward the 18th green and the Havemeyer Trophy on Sunday.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBattling both a blanket of fog that rolled in on the final nine, and self-inflicted damage on the 34th and 35th holes, Strafaci knocked his second from 240 yards onto the par-5 18th to about 15-feet to pull off the shot of the tournament.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nTwo-putting for birdie, Strafaci looked on as his opponent <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/16411/Ollie-Osborne?p=1\">Charles \"Ollie\" Osborne</a> failed to get up and down from short right of the green to force extra holes.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe 36-hole championship match was never short on dramatics. In the morning 18, Osborne took a 5-up lead through the opening 12 holes. Undeterred, Strafaci won four of the final six holes to shave Osborne’s lead to just 1 up before the afternoon round.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn the morning, the duo matched each other with 66s and were 12-under on best ball.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/bandon\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/Two-Man-Links-2021.jpg\"></a></div><br>\r\n\r\nAs the afternoon round started, Strafaci was able to keep the momentum going, tying the match on the 20th hole (No. 2). Strafaci would strike again on the 25th (No. 7) to take his first lead of the match with a 25-foot birdie.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAble to maintain the lead for another five holes, Mother Nature arrived in the form of dense fog to create a coliseum at Bandon Dunes for the gladiatorial showdown. Rangefinders were rendered useless, and at times it became impossible to see where each player was taking aim, much less where their ball went once in the air.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062648.jpg\"><br>Ollie Osborne (USGA photo)</div></div>As the marine layer cooled the temperature, it seemed as though Osborne was the one heating up. The SMU Mustang won the par-5 13th, his first win since playing the par-3 12th in the morning (a hole he nearly had an ace on twice on Sunday).<br><br>\r\n\r\nNot to be outdone, Strafaci came back on the par-4 14th (No. 32) with an eagle 2 to regain the one-hole advantage he had worked so hard for. Tallying another win with a par on the par-3 15th (No. 33) after Osborne could not keep his ball out of the penalty area left of the elevated green, Strafaci looked like he was set to wrap the championship.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBut heading to the 16th, a hole that was seemingly made for such a match-play moment, the match turned in what seemed like a blink of an eye. The fog, as dense as it had been since rolling in four holes prior, made the 16th play to its truest form.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith the landing area completely obscured by the fog, both players took aggressive lines off the tee of the driveable par-4, but Strafaci drew the short straw. In a fairway bunker 83 yards from the hole, Strafaci flew the green and found the penalty area on the cliff's edge. Trying to salvage a halve to go dormie into the 17th, Strafaci hacked at his ball twice in the native grass before conceding the hole to Osborne.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe 17th did not do any favors to the Georgia Tech senior either. After Osborne hit it close from 164 yards, the Yellow Jacket dumped two shots into the penalty are short, taking the match to the 36th tee all square.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIf Strafaci was reeling, he could take consolation in knowing that the 18th hole had been good to him in each of the last three matches. First it was <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/18255/Agustin-Segundo-Oliva-Pinto?p=1\">Segundo Oliva Pinto</a>'s caddie committing an <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/27304/U-S--Amateur--18th-hole-penalty-shocker-helps-set-Elite-Eight\">unthinkable rules violation</a> to hand him the match, then it was a shaky lag putt to four feet that he was able to make to fend off <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/6046/Stewart-Hagestad?p=1\">Stewart Hagestad</a>, and finally it was <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/21354/Aman-Gupta?p=1\">Aman Gupta</a> taking three to get out of a fairway bunker.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHe saved his best finish for last on Sunday, pumping a great drive through the fog to just over 240 yards away. Smashing a 4-iron from the middle of the fairway, Strafaci knew he executed what he visualized through the haze as soon as it came off the face.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“Oh please be good!”<br><br>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\"Oh please be good! Come on! Oh yeah!\"<br><br>What a shot! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TyStrafaci?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TyStrafaci</a> with the RIPPED 4-iron to &#129413; range. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/USAmateur?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#USAmateur</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/wjUioHA5QN\">pic.twitter.com/wjUioHA5QN</a></p>— USGA (@USGA) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USGA/status/1295182582901092355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 17, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><br>\r\n\r\nThe towering draw finished hole-high about 15-feet away.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I told myself that I was going to hit a winning shot when it mattered most under the most pressure in amateur golf,” said Strafaci. “I needed 225 yards to carry the bunkers and if I rip a 4-iron, it goes 225. I wanted to hit it close by hitting the best 4-iron of my life. I knew I could execute it and trusted myself.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nTapping in for birdie, the pressure was on Osborne to convert his 12-foot birdie putt after missing the green short-right. As the putt slid by, Strafaci was able to join Jack Nicklaus (1959) and Hal Sutton (1980) as winners of both the North & South and the U.S. Amateur in the same year.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFor Strafaci, it was personal. His paternal grandfather, Frank Strafaci Sr., played in 16 U.S. Amateurs, never making it past the quarterfinals (1947, 1949). In 1954 Frank was ousted by The King himself, losing to Arnold Palmer in the first round, which Palmer later cited as his toughest match of the week.<br><br>\r\n\r\nStrafaci matched Frank earlier this summer with his <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/26161/North-and-South-Amateur--Tyler-Strafaci-wins-one-for-the-family\">win at the North & South</a>, and now has the family's second USGA championship to go along with the elder Strafaci's U.S. Public Links title in 1935. With his father, Frank Jr. (who played in three U.S. Amateurs himself) on the bag, Strafaci surpassed the man he never got to meet.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“He’s my best friend,” Strafaci said when asked what it meant for his dad to be on his bag this week. “I love him. It’s awesome. He’s such a good guy and my biggest supporter. To do it here with him when I didn’t think I’d have another amateur tournament is something I’ll never forget.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith the win, Strafaci gives Georgia tech their eighth U.S. Amateur title, joining Bobby Jones (five times), Matt Kuchar (1997), and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/76098/Andy-Ogletree\">Andy Ogletree</a> (2019).<br><br>\r\n\r\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Bob Jones x5, Matt Kuchar, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andy_ogletree?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@andy_ogletree</a> and now <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TyStrafaci?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@tystrafaci</a>! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GTGolf?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GTGolf</a> is the first U.S. college to have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/USAmateur?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#USAmateur</a> champions in back-to-back years with different players. <a href=\"https://t.co/dihaKn6Cj2\">pic.twitter.com/dihaKn6Cj2</a></p>— USGA (@USGA) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/USGA/status/1295205824768487424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 17, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><br>\r\n\r\nWith the win, Strafaci earned exemptions into the 2021 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines, the 2021 Open at Royal St. Georges, and will likely be receiving an invitation to the 2021 Masters.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAs for Osborne, he will not be leaving Bandon empty-handed. As the runner up he will also receive an exemption into next year’s U.S. Open and likely a 2021 Masters invite, as well as a spot in the next three U.S. Amateurs so long as he retains amateur status (Strafaci would receive 10 years).<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I thought I played really well,” said Osborne. “I had a couple of hiccups but I thought I played great today. We were both playing really well so it was fun.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nOsborne was trying to become the fifth player from SMU to win the U.S. Amateur, joining Hank Kuehne (1998), Colt Knost (2007), <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/5477/Kelly-Kraft?p=1\">Kelly Kraft</a> (2011) and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/5358/Bryson-DeChambeau?p=1\">Bryson DeChambeau</a> (2015).<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Related Stories</b><br>\r\n<hr>\r\n<ul class=\"contentList\"><li><img src=\"//www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062628.jpg\" alt=\"Ollie Osborne to play Tyler Strafaci in U.S. Amateur Final\"><div class=\"newsLatestTeaser\"><a href=\"/golf-tournament-news/27310/Ollie-Osborne-to-play-Tyler-Strafaci-in-U-S--Amateur-Final\">Ollie Osborne to play Tyler Strafaci in U.S. Amateur Final</a><br/>Aug 15, 2020 - Two father/son combos will go at it Sunday, with Tyler Strafaci and dad chasing his grandfather Frank's legacy</li><li><img src=\"//www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062600.jpg\" alt=\"Semifinals set at U.S. Amateur at Bandon Dunes\"><div class=\"newsLatestTeaser\"><a href=\"/golf-tournament-news/27307/Semifinals-set-at-U-S--Amateur-at-Bandon-Dunes\">Semifinals set at U.S. Amateur at Bandon Dunes</a><br/>Aug 14, 2020 - Tyler Strafaci will face Aman Gupta in the first match, while Ollie Osborne will play Matthew Sharpstene in the other match</li><li><img src=\"//www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062588.jpg\" alt=\"U.S. Amateur: 18th hole penalty shocker helps set Elite Eight\"><div class=\"newsLatestTeaser\"><a href=\"/golf-tournament-news/27304/U-S--Amateur--18th-hole-penalty-shocker-helps-set-Elite-Eight\">U.S. Amateur: 18th hole penalty shocker helps set Elite Eight</a><br/>Aug 13, 2020 - No one has ever seen an ending to a U.S. Amateur match quite like the one that sent Tyler Strafaci on to the quarterfinals</li><li><img src=\"//www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062584.jpg\" alt=\"U.S. Amateur: Medalist upset in round of 32\"><div class=\"newsLatestTeaser\"><a href=\"/golf-tournament-news/27302/U-S--Amateur--Medalist-upset-in-round-of-32\">U.S. Amateur: Medalist upset in round of 32</a><br/>Aug 13, 2020 - What you need to know as the Round of 32 begins its march to the Sweet 16</li><li><img src=\"//www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062573.jpg\" alt=\"U.S. Amateur round of 64: Upsets, Waves, & More\"><div class=\"newsLatestTeaser\"><a href=\"/golf-tournament-news/27301/U-S--Amateur-round-of-64--Upsets--Waves--and-More\">U.S. Amateur round of 64: Upsets, Waves, & More</a><br/>Aug 12, 2020 - Pepperdine makes waves while the No. 1 seed overcomes the odds in the Round of 64 at Bandon Dunes</li><li><img src=\"//www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062572.jpg\" alt=\"The U.S. Amateur stroke play playoff: survive and thrive\"><div class=\"newsLatestTeaser\"><a href=\"/golf-tournament-news/27300/The-U-S--Amateur-stroke-play-playoff--survive-and-thrive\">The U.S. Amateur stroke play playoff: survive and thrive</a><br/>Aug 12, 2020 - David Tenneson looks at the recent history of one of the most exciting parts of U.S. Am week, and how it can propel its survivors</li><li><img src=\"//www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062548.jpg\" alt=\"U.S. Amateur: Wilson Furr shoots course record 62, is medalist\"><div class=\"newsLatestTeaser\"><a href=\"/golf-tournament-news/27298/U-S--Amateur--Wilson-Furr-shoots-course-record-62--is-medalist\">U.S. Amateur: Wilson Furr shoots course record 62, is medalist</a><br/>Aug 11, 2020 - In a tight race for medalist, Wilson Furr posts the round of the tournament to emerge from the pack at 11-under 132</li><li><img src=\"//www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062552.jpg\" alt=\"August Madness?

    "teaser": "Hitting it long doesn't help if it's in the wrong direction. Callaway's new Big Bertha B21 offers a best of both worlds design",
    "articleText": "You can learn a lot watching the new breed of Tour players on TV. The day of the short hitter being successful on Tour is long gone. <br><br>\r\n\r\nSo what do we do? We chase distance of course. Not just because the professional game has changed, but because it's fun. Until the missed fairways start creeping into our scores.<br><br>\r\n\r\nCallaway's got you covered.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Carlsbad, California-based company continues to show they are interested in more than winning the weekly driver count on worldwide tours (although they do that quite often). Which is exactly why they designed a driver (and product family) built for distance any way you swing it. Long, forgiving, and easy to hit. That's what Big Bertha B21 is all about.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Big Bertha B21 is Callaway's first driver to deliver the unique combination ofhigh launch, low spin and significant draw bias in a forgiving head shape. It’s a new formula for distance, built to take the big miss out of your game so you can play from the fairway more often.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe Big Bertha B21 consists of a total ball speed package; Callaway's A.I. Designed Flash Face SS21, Super Strength Materials, and Tour-proven Jailbreak Technology that can help you hit it a long way even if you miss the sweet spot. <br><br>\r\n\r\nIt's a driver designed for players who are looking for a new way to get the most distance out of their swing.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>KEY PRODUCT FEATURES</b><br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Unlock Your Inner Distance</b><br>\r\nIf you want to hit the ball farther, you have to hit it straighter. And to help eliminate a slice orbig miss, Callaway engineers designed their first high launch driver with an ultra-low forward CG for low spin.It’s a new formula for distance to provide a more consistent ball flight, and more tee shots that find the fairway.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Easy To Hit From Bertha Shaping and Added Draw Bias</b><br>\r\nThe large Big Bertha head is specifically engineered with internal draw bias weighting to helpimprove your launch angles and promote a straighter, longer ball flight.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Fast Ball Speed From Callaway's A.I. Designed Flash Face SS21</b><br>\r\nCallaway has advanced their A.I. designed Flash Face to promote fast ball speeds across a more expansive area. So you’ll still hit it a long way, even when you miss the center of the face at impact. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Super Strength Materials For Consistent, High Ball Speeds</b><br>\r\nThis face architecture requires extremely strong materials that are lighter and more resilient than traditional titanium to promote optimal speed, forgiveness, and spin characteristics. <br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Jailbreak + T2C Triaxial Carbon Crown For Ball Speed and Unconventional Forgiveness</b><br>\r\nTwo internal Jailbreak bars connect the sole and crown to promote fast ball speed, and thesignificantly lighter carbon crown redistributes weight for a higher MOI.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>Premium Components Package</b><br>Features a completely new RCH shaft, designed by Callaway to specifically enhance the BigBertha offering, with an Active Tip Flag section for easy launch. And it comes stock with a GolfPride Tour Velvet Soft grip. \r\n\r\n",

Even more impressive, he now has a record 9 Putter Boy trophies, collecting the first two by winning the North & South Amateur in 1995 and 1996.\r\n\r\n“No, it never gets old,” Simson said to Alex Podlogar of Pinehurst. “To have my name up there nine times – seven Seniors and two regulars – nobody else has got that accomplishment.\r\n\r\n“I try to keep as much room between them and me as I can.”\r\n\r\nSimson had not won a national senior event since winning the North & South Senior in 2016, although he nearly got a third U.S. Senior title in 2017 to go along with his three British Senior titles.\r\n\r\nRound 1 was played on the Pinehurst No. 5 course, and there was a logjam of six players (including Simson and Elliott) tied at the top at 2-under 70. In Round 2, Simson struggled out of the gate at Pinehurst No. 8, tripling the first hole and dropping five shots in the first six holes -- the last shots he would drop in the tournament -- en route to a 2-over 74.\r\n\r\nElliott, the <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/golf-tournament-news/22319/The-2018-AGC-Senior-Player-of-the-Year--Gene-Elliott\">2018 AmateurGolf.com Senior Player of the Year</a>, grabbed the solo lead with a 71, two shots ahead of three players, with Simson a part of a group of four players three shots back at even par.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday at Pinehurst No. 2, Simson was the only player to go bogey-free and the only player to break 70 for any tournament round. Even better, he hit every green in regulation on one of the toughest courses in the world to do so, with No. 2's turtleback greens repelling any shot not well-placed. (Simson said it was the first time he had ever achieved the feat at No. 2.) He started well with birdies at the 1st and 3rd holes, added another at the 11th, and got a final birdie at the par-5 16th to close with a 68 and beat his age by a shot.\r\n\r\nElliott still had the lead at the turn after going out in even par, but couldn't make a birdie on the back nine, dropping two shots and finishing with a 74 for a 1-under 215 total, three behind Simson in third place.\r\n\r\nPlaying with Simson, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/9194/Sherrill-Britt?p=1\">Sherrill Britt</a> (West End, N.C.) stayed within a couple of shots all day but ultimately could not catch his playing partner, closing with a 70 to finish solo second at 2 under par.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/1916/Robert-Funk\">Robert Funk</a> (Canyon Lake, Calif.) posted three rounds of even-par 72 to finish 4th, tied with <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/22349/Monty-Guest?p=1\">Monty Guest</a> (Solon, Ohio), who was a part of the first-round lead group and who close with a pair of 73s.\r\n\r\nAmong past champions, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/4457/Pat-Thompson?p=1\">Pat Thompson</a> (2013) finished tied 11th at 3 over, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/12360/Eddie-Hargett?p=1\">Eddie Hargett</a> (2018) was tied 20th at 8 over, and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/117060/TODD-HENDLEY\">Todd Hendley</a> (2017) was tied 24th at 10 over.\r\n\r\nIn the Super Senior division, <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/12725/Stephen-Fox?p=1\">Stephen Fox</a> (Barboursville, W.V.) defended his title with a resounding nine-shot win over <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/12649/Robert-Parmar?p=1\">Robert Parmar</a> (Fairhope, Ala.) and <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Rankings/10341/Evan-Long?p=1\">Evan Long</a> (Charlotte, N.C.). Fox opened with a 70 on Pinehurst No. 2, one shot behind <a href=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/Players/46814/Ed-Donlin\">Ed Donlin</a> (Concord, N.C.), and then took control of the tournament with a 5-under 67 on Pinehurst No. 5.\r\n\r\nOn the final day at Pinehurst No. 8, Fox was using a lot of his cushion, making four bogeys (more than the previous two rounds combined) before finishing in style with three straight birdies and a 73. Fox's winning total was an impressive 6-under 210.",

Luke Potter took that saying to heart at the 121st Southern California Golf Association Amateur Championship this week.\r\n\r\nThe 16-year-old Arizona State verbal commit needed a three-hole aggregate playoff to become the youngest champion in the event’s storied history.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nBeginning the day five shots back of the overnight leader, Caden Fioroni, Potter simply destroyed the front-nine at Goose Creek Golf Club, posting a 28 going away. The opening laser show featured four consecutive birdies which was capped off with an eagle on the par-5 7th giving Potter a five-hole stretch at 6-under par. \r\n\r\n“Starting out five-back, I knew I had to put a low one out there,” Potter told the SCGA. “Just give myself birdie chances and putt well… [it] was a good week.”\r\n\r\nComing off of the U.S. Amateur last week where he was the youngest competitor in the field, Potter said that, “golf’s a funny game, so I just came here with an open mindset.”\r\n\r\nShooting a final round 62 was good, but it still was not enough to the job done or even earn the low round of the tournament.\r\n\r\nThat honor belonged to Fioroni. Carding a third round 61, the incoming Pepperdine freshman had a chance at 59, needing a birdie on the 18th. Posting a bogey, the new Wave settled for a 9-under day.\r\n\r\nFioroni, holding a one-shot lead heading into the 18th on Friday, needed a par to claim the championship. Having two-putts to secure the win, Fioroni blew his birdie attempt 10-feet by, leaving too much meat on the bone as he cleaned up for bogey giving Potter a chance in a three-hole aggregate playoff.\r\n\r\nStarting on the par-3 16th, Potter was able to pull off an up-and-down while Fioroni took a bogey. On the 17th, Fioroni gained the stroke back with a sidewinding 15-footer for birdie while Potter saw his birdie attempt slide by.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th, the pair fired tee shots up the left side leaving perfect angles into the green. Fioroni found the center of the green but left himself a downhill 30-footer while Potter left himself a much more attractive birdie look with an uphill 20-footer.\r\n\r\nAs Fioroni burned the edge, the scene was set for Potter. Burying the putt, Potter spoiled the opportunity for Pepperdine to go back-to-back (Sahith Theegala, 2019).",

The 2019 Rolex Tournament of Champions, 2019 Rolex Junior Player of the Year, and now the 2020 Rolex Girls Junior Championship see Zhang’s name atop the charts.\r\n\r\nBeginning the fourth and final round with a five-shot advantage, Zhang saw no dramatics like she saw in the championship match against Gabriela Ruffels in the U.S. Amateur just two weeks ago.\r\n\r\nZhang was in the captain’s seat the entire front-nine, posting an even-par 36, Zhang needed to pick up the pace holding a slim margin as she and hopeful contenders Bohyun Park and Catherine Rao made the turn.\r\n\r\nZhang did exactly what USGA champions do. She immediately birdied No. 10 to get to 11-under for the championship. Coming down the stretch, Zhang turned on the afterburners to separate herself from the field with four-consecutive birdies on Nos. 15-18 to put away the championship.\r\n\r\nBoth Park and Leila Raines split second-place with totals of 9-under 279. Rao finished in solo fourth after a final round 70 to finish 8-under for the tournament.",

    "articleText": "Russell Williams and Jason Schultz took it to the Bentwater Yacht & Country Club’s Weiskopf Course over the weekend.\r\n\r\nThe duo picked apart the track en route to a 26-under total which featured rounds of 60-64-66 as they picked up a 3-stroke victory.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“It was very nerve-racking,” Williams told the TGA. “I’d never been in that position. But I’ll tell you what, I had the best partner in the field. He was solid all week and I’m just glad that the two or three times a round he needed a little pick up I was able to do that and contribute.”\r\n\r\nTallying 26 birdies and an eagle over 54 holes of golf, the pair meshed together nicely as they only birdied the same hole three times and had five holes where one player birdied while the other bogeyed making it a true team win.\r\n\r\n“It was a fun environment from start to finish,” Schultz said. “We kind of just built from day one and kept going from there.”\r\n\r\nPlaying one more round, Williams and Schultz may have been able to catch Dustin Johnson’s remarkable 30-under performance at the Northern Trust at TPC Boston this past weekend.\r\n\r\nIn the senior division, Mike Peck and Steve Love snagged the win in dramatic fashion.\r\n\r\nOn the ninth (their closing hole) the team needed a birdie to avoid a playoff with clubhouse leaders Lewis Stephenson and John Pierce who were at 19-under. Love struck his approach to just 12-feet above the hole, giving the team a great look at birdie. As Peck cleaned up a lagged birdie attempt for par, the stage was set for Love.\r\n\r\n“It’s exciting for me because I don’t get to do this as much as Mike,” Love said. “Mike held us together the whole back nine. It was amazing the putts he was making for par. We kind of teamed it up and got through it, so it was really exciting.”\r\n\r\nLove knocked home their 23rd and most important birdie of the championship to claim the victory.\r\n\r\n“Anytime you win one of the TGA’s major tournaments it’s truly an honor,” Peck said.“It’s fantastic to do it with a great friend. It was a team victory and couldn’t have been any better.”",

    "title": "ICYMI: Sample is youngest MET Open champ in its 105-year history",
    "teaser": "High schooler Luke Sample was the first amateur to win in 15 years and the youngest in over a century of Metropolitan Opens",
    "articleText": "Luke Sample of Old Oaks stole the show during Thursday’s final round, shooting a 3-under 68 to win the 105th Met Open Championship Presented by Callaway to become just the 8th amateur in the championship’s history to do so. Sample, 17, also becomes the youngest player to ever win the Met Open, shattering the record previously held by Johnson Wagner when he won as an amateur at 21. He’s also the first amateur to win in 15 years, since John Stotlz won at Old Westbury.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nSample started his final round two shots off Gore’s 7-under lead and in the penultimate pairing thanks to two under-par rounds of 69-68. After a messy double bogey on the par-3 fourth hole, he bounced back with a par on No. 5, and then began a birdie barrage to jump to the top of the leaderboard. “It was a frustrating one for sure, [the tee shot on four] was probably my least committed swing of the week, and it wasn’t an easy par from where I left myself, and it also wasn’t an easy bogey. Unfortunately I walked away with a double but Cole [Ekert, his caddie] kept me in there once again, he did such a great job of keeping me positive and not letting me go sideways this week,” he said.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“We hit the reset button on the next hole and almost holed it from the fairway, and ended up making par unfortunately. Once six rolled around we said we have two par-5s coming up, let’s at least birdie the par-5s and get to the back nine and make a run there.”<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E4q73B8u3ik\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br>\r\n\r\nSample did birdie the par-5 sixth, but didn’t stop there. He kept his birdie streak going on Nos. 7, 8, and the par-5 9th to take a two shot lead. “I said it yesterday, I’d been kind of waiting for the putts to roll in and the approach shots finishing closer than 15-20 feet, and I finally got a couple that finished at 3 or 4 feet, and had a couple of kick-in birdies,” Sample said.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“Cole once again helped me pick some great targets. The one into 8 was really just a lucky break to hit it to within 2, 3, feet, and I had no business going at that pin. I hit a pretty hard push to the right and just happened to finish two feet from the hole. Those are the kind of breaks you need in a tournament like this.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nOn the 505-yard ninth, his chip from about 20 feet short of the green nearly went in, but he settled for a tap-in birdie. “I had a very similar pitch shot into nine yesterday, which was my final hole, and pretty much just hit the same exact shot, but this time I converted for birdie which was helpful going to the back,” he shared.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSample started off the back nine with his fifth consecutive birdie on no. 10. “I told Cole going to the back nine, if we get one or two more, I think two definitely, it gives me a really good chance to run away with this, but I also said we don’t need to force anything because people can still go backwards and there’s no need to put myself in a hole I don’t need to be in.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nOn the par-4 12th, he played aggressively and sent his drive nearly 50 yards past where other competitors had been placing their tee shots. “I got to 12, and I think most people have been laying up back there and hitting a long iron or a three-wood off that tee, and I just kind of felt like we should keep the momentum going and just went full send on a driver, and it worked out,” Sample said. It worked out just fine – his second shot got him to within two feet for this sixth birdie of the day.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThrough 12, he was 9-under and four shots clear of the rest of the field. Meanwhile, 2015 champion Ben Polland of Deepdale was finished with his round and in the clubhouse with at 5-under and what turned out to be the low round of the day with a 67, due to four birdies in his final round and no bogeys on the card. Fairview’s Paul Pastore was making a run and got to 6-under through 11, but he then struggled with back-to-back bogeys on 13 and 14. A birdie on 17 brought him at 5-under, matching Polland’s score.<br><br>\r\n\r\nMichael Graboyes of Watchung Valley and Jay Card of Gardiner’s Bay both finished with 3-under totals and matching rounds of 71-69-70. Graboyes had four consecutive birdies of his own on 6-9, and had two more on the back, struggled with bogeys on Nos. 13, 16, and 18.<br><br>\r\n\r\nBy this point, Sample had recovered from a bogey on the par-3 14th, after two putting from the front of the green of the 15th. He kept his play consistent the rest of the way in with pars, finishing his back nine at 1-under to sign for a final round 3-under 68 and the win.  <br><br>\r\n\r\nSecond round leader Jason Gore of Hamilton Farm was in the final pairing but struggled with three bogeys early on his final round. A birdie on nine helped the scorecard, but a double on the par-4 13th set him back a couple more shots. He birdied 18 for the second consecutive day to finish with a 3-over 74, bringing him to 4-under and a T4 finish in his first Met Open.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAlso finishing at 4-under was Steve Shellock of Suneagles, who put together rounds of 70-70-69 this week. Shellock grabbed the lead early on during the final round thanks to birdies on Nos. 2, 3, and 6 to make the turn at 3-under. He only recorded one bogey, on 14, but kept his round under-par for the third-straight day.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith his win, Sample becomes just the eighth amateur in the championship’s 105 year history to add his name to the Walker L. Trammell trophy. “There are some pretty spectacular winners on there. I don’t think its quite set in yet and it might not for a while, but hopefully this isn’t the last time I get to put my name on there, and just being able to be a part of that history is really special,” he said.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSample has had a spectacular summer of golf. In July, he qualified for both the 118th Met Amateur and 65th Ike MGA Stroke Play championships at a join qualifier at New Jersey National. That same afternoon, he went on to Rockaway River to begin his run to the 103rd Met Junior title, which he won on July 15. Later that month, he qualified for the Met Open with a 4-under at Cherry Valley (N.J.), and two days later finished in third place at the MGA Carter Cup at Canoe Brook (where his caddie, Cole Ekert, finished as the runner-up). With not one day of rest in between, he headed to Bethpage Black for the 118th Met Amateur. He advanced to the finals, and after a great stretch of golf was defeated by champion Jack Wall.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter the Met Amateur, Sample finished in the top-10 at the Ike at Darien just last week, but also found time to practice for Mountain Ridge. “I went to work on some chipping and pitching and then started working hard on the putting again. I got the putting back again this week to where I felt like I was at the Met Junior, which was really big,” he said.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSample held off a number of other top players for his win, including Casey Pyne of Stanwich, who he was paired with today. Pyne shot a final round 75 to finish at 1-under for the week, along with Ethan Ng (a) of Knickerbocker, Sam Goldenring (a) of Brooklake, Pat Fillian of Echo Lake, and Luke Graboyes of Wachung Valley.  <br><br>\r\n\r\nHeaded into his senior year the Trevor Day School in Manhattan and already verbally committed to play at Duke, Sample can proudly say he had a successful summer of golf, capped off by a record breaking win at Mountain Ridge. “It means everything. Last year [at Piping Rock] I thought I played some amazing golf, and finished, I think, outside of the top 30, and to be able to come back from that a little bit of heart break at the Met Am, and just show myself and show everybody that I can compete at whatever level that I’m put against, it means everything.\"<br><br>\r\n\r\nMoutain Ridge was once again the ultimate host for the club’s fourth Met Open Championship. Previous Met Opens at Mountain Ridge were won by Tom Nieporte (1966), George Zahringer, another amateur winner (1985), and Mike Gilmore (2000). Since last hosting the Met Open in 2000, the classic Donald Ross layout has gone through extensive changes, highlighted by tree removal and restoration work led by architect Ron Prichard. Superintendent Cliff Moore and his staff had the course in supreme condition to challenge this year’s competitors.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe top 25 players from this year’s championship are exempt into the 106th Met Open Championship, to be played at Hudson National Golf Club.",

    "teaser": "Battling a familiar foe, the Glenview, Illinois native was comfortable in his comeback victory",
    "articleText": "40-year-old John Ramsey battled his way to his first individual Chicago District Golf Association title, claiming victory at the 28th Illinois State Mid-Am Championship hosted by Edgewood Valley Country Club in La Grange, Illinois.\r\n\r\n“It was the most comfortable day and I can’t be thankful enough for that,” Ramsey told the CDGA. “I play with Chadd (Slutzky) all the time, I’ve got my good buddy on the bag and I’ve played quite a few rounds with (John) Ehrgott. So the comfort of the day really helped.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nWith a comfortable yet buttoned-up atmosphere in the final group, Ramsey got off to a hot start following a self-proclaimed “horrible range session” prior to the final round. Tallying three-straight birdies to begin the round, Ramsey quickly took the lead from Ehrgott as he was 1-under for the tournament standing on the fourth tee.\r\n\r\nCarding two more birdies on Nos. 7 and 9, Ramsey went out in 31 and was two shots clear of Ehrgott as the pair made the turn making the championship a two-man race.\r\n\r\nBiding his time, the two-time Illinois Mid-Am champion Ehrgott put the pressure on Ramsey after carding back-to-back birdies on Nos. 13 and 14, shrinking Ramsey’s lead to just one shot. But, for Ramsey, having the one contender playing in his group was something he was once again comfortable with.\r\n\r\n“It was nice to have your opponent right there with you, so I think that helped me a lot just to see what he was doing to kind of play off of him,” Ramsey said.\r\n\r\nEhrgott had an opportunity to sneak through the crack in the door he worked hard to get open on the par-5 16th. Leaving himself pin-high and just off the green in two while Ramsey had to battle an awkward stance and was 100-yards from the hole with his third, both players walked away with pars, essentially closing the door on Ehrgott.\r\n\r\nFollowing up the par on No. 16 with a bogey on 17, Ehrgott gave Ramsey a two-shot cushion heading into the par-4 18th.\r\n\r\nUsing the cushion, Ramsey raked in a bogey on 18 to claim the title with a 4-under 68 and a tournament total 2-under 214.\r\n\r\n“It feels really good,” said Ramsey. “This is kind of the one I’ve been looking for, for a long time and it feels really good to finally do it.”",

    "articleText": "Five players led the way Wednesday at a weather-shortened stroke play portion of the Women’s Amateur Championship. \r\n\r\nAmalie Leth-Nissen (Denmark), Carolina Melgrati (Italy), and a trio of English women; Rosie Belsham, Emily Price, and Isabelle Simpson all tallied rounds of 1-under-par to claim the top five seeds in the 2020 Women’s Amateur.\r\n\r\nThe field of 91 was trimmed to 64 after one round of play due to Tuesday’s round of stroke play being squashed due to torrential rains. Wednesday’s round was delayed an hour due to high winds in the Liverpool area.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nPrice, who won the English Women’s Amateur earlier this month, surprised herself knocking home three birdies en route to her 1-under 71.\r\n\r\n“Starting the round with high winds and the rain we had, I wasn’t expecting [to shoot] under par,” Price told the R&A. “I got off to a slow start, but I was solid from then and had a good back nine with three birdies. I’ve been playing well recently and it’s good to keep my form going.”\r\n\r\nLeth-Nissen finished strong as she carded three birdies on her final five holes to secure a first-round match which will renew her sibling rivalry with her sister, Cecille, during Thursday’s morning session.\r\n\r\n“My sister, Cecille, is here this week too,” Leth-Nissen told the R&A. “We train a lot together, always play in the same tournaments, and hope for the best for each other.”\r\n\r\n2019 champion Emily Toy (England) made match play by the skin of her teeth on the 6-over cut line. Ninth-ranked Lily May Humphreys also snuck in on the cut line which was decided by a card countback.\r\n\r\nTwo-time Senior Women’s Amateur champion, Laura Webb, posted a 3-over 75 to make match play as the 18-seed and will face Lily Huerliman in the Round of 64.\r\n\r\nBarring any further delays, the field of 64 will be trimmed to 16 with a morning and afternoon match play session set for Thursday.",

    "articleText": "Just like the Women’s Amateur,  the Men’s Amateur was impacted thanks to strong storms on Tuesday, forcing the R&A to shorten stroke play qualifying to just 18-holes for each championship.\r\n\r\n16-year-old Scotland native Ruben Lindsay was able to tame the 10-time Open host Royal Birkdale with a 4-under 67 to claim the No. 1 overall seed as match play is set to begin Thursday morning.\r\n\r\nThe 2019 Scottish Boys’ Amateur Champion tallied four birdies and an eagle en route to his stroke play victory. His morning match will be accompanied by Sam Bairstow in the Round of 64.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“I am very pleased, I played some really good stuff out there,” Lindsay told the R&A. I just didn’t really make any mistakes until the last. I am really pleased with that round.”\r\n\r\nSeeing just two bogeys in the duration of his round, Lindsay secured the top spot by a single spot Englishman Mason Essam who posted a 3-under 68 to claim the No. 2 seed. \r\n\r\nEngland’s Sam Broadhurst would have had a shot at the top spot if it weren’t for a pesky triple-bogey on the 3rd.\r\n\r\n“Obviously it was not the ideal start, I blocked a 9 iron into the rough and it was quite thick so I struggled to get it out,” Broadhurst said. “Walking off the green I was thinking there was a lot of golf to be played and par-5’s to take advantage of so I knew it wasn’t the end of the world.”\r\n\r\nBroadhurst recovered well and finished with a 2-under 69, good for a tie for third.\r\n\r\nThe Round of 64 will be cut to 16 with two rounds of play Thursday with the championship match set for Saturday.",

    "articleText": "It’s been said it can be tougher to win a golf tournament on your home course, because everyone expects you to win. West Des Moines’ Gene Elliott knew that all too well to a certain extent this week at the 42nd Iowa Senior Amateur at Crow Valley Golf Club, a place he grew up playing.\r\n\r\n“That’s what I told the members here at Crow Valley,” Elliott said. “But this isn’t my home golf course anymore. I have been over every inch of property at this golf course and probably have had every putt out there.”\r\n\r\nElliott (+5), who finished with rounds of 74-73-71 (218), got off to a quick start in Wednesday’s final round, with an opening nine holes in 32 (-3). A couple slight bumps in the road on holes 14-16 made things more interesting down the stretch, but with two pars to finish, Elliott won his fifth Iowa Senior Amateur title by a shot over Muscatine’s Tom Norton (+6), who posted his own final round 71 (E).\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nElliott admitted, regardless of how many times you’ve played at Crow Valley GC one thing remains the same – the difficulty of the greens are nothing to lose sight of.\r\n\r\n“These are some of the toughest greens in the midwest,” Elliott said. “It doesn’t matter how many times you have played here, the putts are still hard.”\r\n\r\nElliott, who recently played in the U.S. Amateur in Oregon, a tournament loaded with ‘kids’ much younger, said it’s good to be back competing against players over 50.\r\n\r\n“It’s nice playing with my own age group,” Elliott said. “As long as I am still standing, we’ll go for a sixth (title) next year.”\r\n\r\nIn the Super Senior Division, Marshalltown’s Rob Christensen (above right) outlasted fellow Marshalltown resident Pat Ryan by eight shots overall after a fine final round of 70 (-1), including a near hole-out to end his tournament on the par three 9th hole.\r\n\r\n“That was a nice way to finish,” Christensen said. “I birdied a lot of par threes this week.”\r\n\r\nChristensen commented that he was able to pick up a lot of ‘home course’ knowledge during his practice round and without a doubt that was the key to his success in the Quad Cities this week.\r\n\r\n“I owe a lot to Bill Tank, a member here (at Crow Valley),” Christensen said. “He took us around during our practice round and told us where to hit, not to hit it. He said whatever you do, do not be above the hole. That was the key for me, I kept it below the hole all week.”",

Unlike the U.S. Amateur, where a playoff pares the field down to exactly 64 players for match play, the British Amateur allows everyone tying for 64th place to enter match play, with a select group of players having to play a preliminary round of match play to get the field to 64. Four matches were played in that first round this morning.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nOnce the field was pared to 64, England’s Benjamin Schmidt, the top ranked player in the field, played solid golf to record a 3&2 victory over Brandon Dietzel of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe 18-year-old advances to meet Callan Barrow after the Englishman, who finished runner-up in the English Men’s Amateur Championship, defeated Lewis Irvine of Scotland 2&1. \r\n\r\n16-year-old Ruben Lindsay of Scotland, who led qualifying and received the top match play seed, was knocked out 2&1 by Ilari Saulo of Finland who had previously disposed of England’s Sam Bairstow 3&1 in the first round of matches in the morning.  \r\n\r\nThe Finnish Amateur Champion will now go head-to-head with Victor H. Sidal Svendsen of Denmark who beat Ben Chamberlain of Wales by one hole.  \r\n\r\nThe most anticipated match of the day was one between two winners of prominent English titles.\r\n\r\nHaving qualified for the match play stage by a single stroke, Frenchman David Ravetto, who won the Brabazon Trophy last week, went head-to-head with the English Amateur champion Jack Cope. Opening with a birdie, Ravetto went one-up after the first before comfortably winning the match 5&4. He will now play Marc Hammer of Germany on Friday after he earned his place in the next round by winning his match 2&1 over Rasmus Karlsson of Finland.       \r\n\r\nThomas Plumb, a member of the 2019 Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, got off to a fast start, taking a six-up lead at the turn and cruising to a 4&3 victory over Robert Moran of Ireland.\r\n\r\nPlumb will now face fellow Englishman Callum Farr in the third round after he progressed by defeating Davide Buchi of Italy by one hole.\r\n\r\nDrawing inspiration from Padraig Harrington, Ireland’s Mark Power won his match against Jannik de Bruyn of Germany thanks to a 2&1 victory. He advances to play England’s Jack Dyer in the last-32.   \r\n\r\nThis is only the fourth time The Amateur Championship has been hosted at Royal Birkdale following the previous stagings in 1946, 1989 and 2005. \r\n\r\nThe match play stage continues tomorrow with the last-16 and last-eight ties, with the winner in Sunday’s 36-hole final gaining exemptions into The 149th Open at Royal St George’s next July and by tradition, an invitation to play in the Masters Tournament and an exemption to the US Open.\r\n\r\n<i>Thanks to the R&A for the information in this report.</i>",

After bad weather reduced qualifying to 18 holes, Toy struggled to a 78 and only progressed to match play via scorecard playoff.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nToy saw off the challenge of fellow Englishwoman Isabelle Simpson with a one-hole win in the morning before following it up with a comfortable 5&4 triumph over Ireland’s Jessica Ross.\r\n\r\nEmily Price, who won the English Women’s Amateur Championship earlier this month and was among the leading stroke play qualifiers, is also still alive, beating Hulda Clara Gestsdottir from Iceland 2&1 to reach the last-16.\r\n\r\nThe day started with an emotional contest between sisters that went to the final hole.\r\n\r\nDenmark’s Amalie Leth-Nissen – who was the leading qualifier on card countback – lost out to her older sister, Cecilie. It was a notable triumph, given Cecilie is ranked 765th on the World Amateur Golf Ranking compared to Amalie at 47th.\r\n\r\nHowever, Scotland’s Hannah Darling, 17, the Girls’ Under-16 Open Champion in 2018, then ended the hopes of Leth-Nissen in the afternoon with a one-hole victory.\r\n\r\nOf the other leading qualifiers from Wednesday, Rosie Belsham lost to Annabel Bailey by one hole and Carolina Melgrati from Italy also exited at the 19th to Wales’ Ffion Tynan.\r\n\r\nLaura Webb, the oldest player in the field at 57, won her first match before Tynan took her out with a 2&1 victory.\r\n\r\nItalian Alessia Nobilio, the world number five, quietly went about her work to reach the last-16, while two German players, Paula Schulz-Hanssen and Aline Krauter, also progressed. Lily May Humphreys, the highest-ranked English player in the field, now faces Schulz-Hanssen tomorrow.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was disappointment for home club member Hollie Muse and Scotland’s Hazel MacGarvie as they exited at the last-64 stage.\r\n\r\nThe match play continues tomorrow, with the last-16 and quarter-final ties played, ahead of Saturday’s semi-finals and the 18-hole Final. There are significant rewards for the champion with exemptions into the AIG Women’s Open and traditionally, the US Women’s Open, The Evian Championship and Augusta National Women's Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\n<i>Thanks to the R&A for the information in this report.</i>",

    "articleText": "Breaking 60 is not only one of the most difficult things to do in golf but one of the hardest things to accomplish in sports.<br><br>\r\n\r\nScottie Scheffler became just the eleventh PGA Tour member to break 60 at the Northern Trust just last week. Jim Furyk is the only PGA Tour player to post two sub-60 rounds in competition as he holds both a 59 and a 58 on Tour.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFormer University of Central Oklahoma golfer Alexander Hughes didn’t just break 60...he obliterated it.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHughes joined a junior golfer on August 27 to show the junior the ins and outs of South Lakes Golf Course in Tulsa, Oklahoma prior to this weekend’s OJGT event at the course.<br><br>\r\n\r\nAnd boy did he lay the course out beautifully.<br><br>\r\n\r\nHughes carded a 16-under-par 55 on a round that was somewhat played on a whim. Joined by a random twosome, Hughes dazzled the group with a round of a lifetime.<br><br>\r\n\r\nOpening the round with a measly par, Hughes quickly made it a round to remember as he secured an ace on the 155-yard par-3 2nd. A mere footnote to his round, the star of the show was Hughes’ putter.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"articleImage\"><div style=\"float:right; padding-left: 15px;\"><img src=\"https://www.amateurgolf.com/images/uploads/00062803.jpg\"><br>Photo courtesy of TJ Eckert<br><br></div></div>\r\n\r\nHaving not been putting up to his standards, Hughes stopped by Golf Galaxy two and a half hours before teeing it up at South Lakes. Replacing his oversized grip with the classic tour velvet ‘pistol’ grip on his ever-so-trusted PING Redwood blade, Hughes was given back the feel he grew accustomed to growing up.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I just took it out there,” Hughes told AmateurGolf.com. “It felt really good in my hands, I was trying to slow my tempo down putting-wise. I just kind of hit a groove.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nGrooving better than Studio 54 in the ‘70s, Hughes went 7-under over a six-hole stretch to close out the front nine with a 26.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“I knew it was pretty special after the eagle on nine,” he said. “That was about a 20, 25-footer that rolled in for eagle. From there I was just like ‘Alright, I guess keep going lower, keep doing the same thing.’ I just kept the ball rolling.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nJust as golf would have it, even a 55 has its trouble spots. Hughes went wayward off the par 4 11th tee and was inches from being out of bounds, up against a fence. Taking his medicine, he opted to flip over his 9-iron and brought out his inner Phil Mickelson to give himself an up-and-down opportunity from around 100 yards out of the left rough. Lobbing a three-quarter 60-degree to 20-feet, Hughes told himself “There’s no reason I can’t knock this in.” Avoiding spike marks, the ball trickled in for his first par since No. 3 to keep the momentum going.<br><br>\r\n\r\nComing back with a birdie on No. 12, Hughes felt as though he dropped shots with back-to-back pars on Nos. 13 and 14. On what Hughes calls “the only negative thing that happened during the round”, he missed an 8-foot birdie putt that simply did not break and grazed the left edge for a tap-in par.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThrough 14, all Hughes needed to do was go 1-under the rest of the way to post a 59. With the par-5 15th ahead of him, he had other plans. Taking advantage of his length, Hughes got on in two and once again relied on his putter to make up for his ‘mistake’ pars.  Sinking a 35-foot eagle on 15 to go 13-under on the day, reality began to creep into his head.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“Right when I did that the two random guys I was playing with were losing their minds,” Hughes said through a laugh. “When I rolled that in I was like ‘okay’ I think I was in the 50s at that point. So I was kind of thinking about it but I was confident all day.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nLike a pitcher throwing a perfect game, Hughes knew what he needed to get done, and trusted the stuff that got him there.<br><br>\r\n\r\n“That’s kind of the attitude I’ve always had,” said Hughes. “I’m not too worried about things. It’s been helpful to me in my golf career, but its also been sometimes not so helpful. Golf coaches have talked to me about that in the past.”<br><br>\r\n\r\nWith the help of Pat Bates and Josh Fosdick who were Hughes’ coaches at Central Oklahoma, Hughes has found a balance of his naturally fiery competitiveness and his laidback mindset to help him get to where he is today.<br><br>\r\n\r\nFollowing the eagle on No. 15, Hughes tallied three more birdies to close out the round and put himself in the record books not only at South Lakes but globally. Per Golf Channel, Rhein Gibson, an Australian who played for Oklahoma Christian posted a 55 at River Oaks in Edmond, Oklahoma just two hours southwest of Tulsa back in May of 2012. And in 1962, Homero Blancas shot a 55 at a local tournament at Premier Golf Club in Longview, Texas, although that course measured just over 5000 yards. To everyone’s knowledge, these rounds are the lowest attested and verified scores ever recorded.<br><br>\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to his future in golf Hughes is hoping to break through on the professional level as he is currently a pro but has missed the cut all three All-Pro Tour events he has played. With a degree in criminal justice and a strong support group, Hughes has a bright future ahead of him no matter which path he chooses.",

    "articleText": "Defending champion Emily Toy (England) is joined by Annabell Fuller (England), Aline Krauter (Germany), and Emile Alba Paltrinieri(Italy) as the final four women standing at the Women’s Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\nToy, who has had a remarkable defense run after making match play on the cutline on Wednesday, advanced with a thrilling 19 hole victory over Lithuania’s Gile Bite Starkute.\r\n\r\nPrior to the afternoon win, Toy needed all extra holes to move past Chloe Goadby (Scotland) to the quarterfinals. Winning the 18th thanks to a Goadby water ball, the two players halved the 19th before Toy grabbed the win on the 20th to set up the quarterfinals match with Stakute.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n4 down through 10, Toy stormed back as she knocked in a tough up-and-down on the 18th before taking the win on the 19th.\r\n\r\nSurviving 39 holes of golf on Friday, Toy faces Aline Krauter at 8:30 am local time as she looks to make it to the championship match to successfully defend her title.\r\n\r\n“You have to stick around, not give your opponent anything or give away cheap holes,” Toy told the R&A. “It’s a case of digging in deep and my confidence levels then rose. After 39 holes, I’ll sleep well tonight!”\r\n\r\nComing off a win at the English Women’s Open Amateur Stroke Play Championship last week, Annabell Fuller continued her skilled birdie sniping with four birdies over her first seven holes against Elite Wight opponent Alessia Nobilio (Italy). Not going down without a fight, Nobilio earned wins on the back nine to bring the match back to all square on the 18th tee. Taking aim from 192-yards out in typical windy English conditions, Fuller put her approach to two-feet, netting her the win and a spot in the semifinals.\r\n\r\n“That shot from 192 yards is one of the best of my career,” Fuller said. “I’ve had a few that have been important. It felt so good to do it. After being up on the back nine and then dropping a couple of shots, and then Alessia making a birdie two on the 17th, I felt on 18 I really needed to get it together. After she just missed the green with her third shot, I thought it might be my chance to get it close, and two feet kind of helped!”\r\n\r\nFuller faces another Italian in the semifinals as she takes on Emile Alba Paltrinieri.\r\n\r\nBoth matches are set to tee off before 9:00 am local time. 18 holes are set on the dockett before Sunday’s 36-hole title match.",

    "articleText": "After two days of stroke play, just eight players can keep their names in the pot as the weekend approaches Royal Birkdale.\r\n\r\nIreland’s Mark Power is keeping title hopes alive for his countrymen as a win would give Ireland back-to-back Amateur titles. Defeating England’s Jack Dyer 2&1 in the morning session, Power met Germany’s Marc Hammer in a battle of forces. Power took a 3 up lead through seven holes when Hammer buckled down to get the match back to 1 up in Power’s favor through No. 15. Clinching the win with a birdie, Power now has a date with this year’s English Men’s Amateur runner-up, Callan Barrow, in the quarterfinals.\r\n\r\n“I feel like I am easing into it now,” Power told the R&A. “I have won every game 2&1 but every game is different and I feel like I am ready for any challenge.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nEnglishman Joe Harvey was quick to secure his spot in the quarterfinals after defeating fellow countryman Islam Habebul 5&4.\r\n\r\n“I was six up through 10,” Harvey said. “I played really solid on the front nine. Islam is a great golfer but he made a few mistakes early on and I capitalized.”\r\n\r\nBarrow, who faces Power on Saturday, advanced by way of knocking out one of the best amateurs in the world. Benjamin Schmidt (No. 49) picked up an ‘L’ as he was defeated 4&3 by Barrow. In the afternoon session, Barrow defeated Switzerland’s Loris Schuepbach 5&4 to set up a match against Power in the semifinals.\r\n\r\nDenmark’s Victor Svendsen played solidly to eliminate Callum Farr (England) 4&2 to match up with Joe Harvey.\r\n\r\n“It was a tough match,” Svendsen said. “I thought it was going to be a very short day because Callum played some really nice shots on the first couple of holes. I thought I could be in trouble and that I really needed to get myself together which I did. It was a good match; it was fun being out there and feeling my heart pumping.”\r\n\r\nIn the lone match to go the full 18 in the afternoon, fellow Dane Hamish William Brown defeated Marc Boucher (Ireland).\r\n\r\nSaturday will see the remaining field cut from eight to just two as quarter and semifinal play will take place, making way for the 36-hole championship match on Sunday.",

    "articleText": "Stanford’s Aline Krauter claimed her first major title at West Lancashire in Liverpool on Saturday.\r\n\r\nThe German national defeated 2019 champion Emily Toy (England) in the morning’s semifinal match 2&1 to earn her spot in the 18-hole final on Saturday afternoon.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nHer opponent? Englishwoman Annabel Fuller. Fuller cruised to the final match with a morning win against Italy’s Emilie Alba Paltrinieri 5&4.\r\n\r\nKrauter fell 3 down quickly through the first four holes. Despite the deficit, Krauter was confident in her abilities to mount a comeback.\r\n\r\n“I was three down early, but I didn’t panic,” Krauter told the R&A. “It was a rough start but I knew that I had my game and I had played well all week. I wasn’t really worried at that time. I made a great putt from off the green on the ninth which was good.”\r\n\r\nSnagging her first win on the par-5 5th with a birdie, Krauter took another birdie win on the par-3 6th to trim Fuller’s lead to just 1 up. Turning the match on its head, Krauter tied the match on the par-4 8th to get the match back to all square before she tallied another birdie win on the aforementioned par-4 9th to obtain her first lead of the match.\r\n\r\nWith five wins over a six-hole stretch (Nos. 5-10), Krauter never looked back. With a par win on the par-4 10th, Krauter had all the momentum she needed to ice last week’s English Women’s Open Amateur Stroke Play champion in Fuller.\r\n\r\nExtending her lead to 3 up on the par-3 12th with a par, the match then turned stagnant over the next three holes. Not going down without a fight, Fuller made a valiant effort to mount a comeback of her own with a birdie win on par-5 16th and a par on the par-3 17th, cutting Krauter’s cushion to just 1 up as they headed to the 18th tee.\r\n\r\n“I hit a bad shot on the 16th and 17th wasn’t great as I had a bad lie in the bunker,” Krauter said. “But on the 18th I don’t think I’ve ever been so scared for a two-putt. It ended up working out.”\r\n\r\nSettling her nerves, Krauter was able to two-putt for par and halve the last for a 1 up championship victory.\r\n\r\nWith the win, Krauter is now exempt (as an amateur) into the AIG Women’s Open, U.S. Women’s Open, The Evian Championship, and the Augusta National Women’s Amateur.\r\n\r\n“I’m now so excited to play in the AIG Women’s Open,” Krauter exclaimed. “I’m honored. I watched Sophia (Popov) win last week, it was amazing. I had a club fitting with her in February before COVID-19 when everything was fine. To play in the event next year at Carnoustie will be amazing.”",

    "articleText": "Joe Harvey and Joe Long make up the first all-England final for the first time since 1999 when Graeme Storm bested Aran Wainwright 7&6 at Royal County Down when both Harvey and Long were still in diapers.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nBoth Harvey and Long are familiar with one another’s games as they are usually found practicing together at The Kendleshire. However, this go around, there is much more than just bragging rights on the line. The winner of Sunday’s championship match will receive exemptions into the 149th Open at Royal St. Georges, the 2021 U.S. Open, and the 2021 Masters.\r\n\r\nHarvey cruised to the semifinals with a morning session quarterfinal win over Denmark’s Victor Svendsen 4&3. I the semis, Harvey met Ireland’s Mark Power.\r\n\r\n3 up after six holes of play against Power, Harvey turned up the heat on the back nine. Tallying a win on the par-4 10th, Harvey’s lead was trimmed on the par-3 12th, his first loss since No. 7.  Recouping the 4 up advantage on the 14th, Power simply ran out of holes following his win on the 15th, losing the match 3&2 to Harvey after a halve of the 16th.\r\n\r\n“It’s just unbelievable,” Harvey told the R&A. “I’m overwhelmed with emotion right now. I played great out there today. He [Power] had a go at the end when I went four up, and I nearly messed it up. But I got a good up and down on 16 to halve the hole and win.”\r\n\r\nOn his path to the final, Joe Long absolutely dominated his quarterfinal match, winning 6&5 over fellow Englishman Barclay Brown.\r\n\r\nIn the semifinals, Long sought battle with another countryman, Jake Bolton. Putting up a much better challenge against Long, the two Englishmen duked it out through the 17th green with Long coming away with a 2 up victory.\r\n\r\n“Jake was playing quite nicely,” Long said. “He had a birdie putt on the 4th and I just kept it in play. I missed a few putts but I didn’t let that get to me because I committed to the shot. I just kept on trying to hit it in the fairway and trying to make pars. That was the main thing. I had a few birdie chances which I missed but, overall, I just stuck with it really. I battled hard. That’s what you have to do.”\r\n\r\nWith both finalists being good mates, there is a sense of comfort as the pair head into the 36-hole championship match on Sunday.\r\n\r\n“A couple of weeks ago we [Long and Harvey] were actually just playing in a midweek medal together,” said Long. “So, we’ve known each other for a while and we are really good mates. This is going to be played in great spirits and we’ve got to both go out there and enjoy it really. Enjoy the experience and enjoy the challenge.”",

    "teaser": "Two Englishmen and close friends battled at Royal Birkdale for more than bragging rights",
    "articleText": "With 36 holes separating them from glory, two longtime friends settled the 125th Amateur Championship at Royal Birkdale.\r\n\r\n“It was quite relaxing having one of my good mates out there with me,” Joe Harvey told the R&A. “But we were both out there to win so between shots we would have a little bit of a chat, but coming up to our shots we were in the zone.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nFirst to take a lead, Joe Long broke the stagnant match between his close friend, Harvey, with a birdie on the par-4 5th. Splitting the 6th with birdies, Harvey squared the match back with a par on the par-3 7th. Ending the three-hole volley, Long regained a slim lead via concession on the 8th.\r\n\r\nNabbing wins on the 10th and 11th, Long saw his lead swell to 3 up. Maintaining the lead until he conceded the par-5 15th and lost the par-4 16th, he managed to gain back a 2 up lead via a birdie on the 17th, taking the lead into the halfway point of the match.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon 18, the duo split see-sawed four of the first five holes (Nos. 19-23) with pars taking the wins on holes 19, 21, and 23 as Long saw his lead trimmed to just 1 up. Firing back-to-back birdies on Nos. 8 and 9, Long regained a 3 up lead through 25 holes.\r\n\r\nHarvey, attempting to stop the bleeding, grabbed a par win on the 27th (No. 9), stubbing Long’s momentum for the time being as the group made the turn in the home nine.\r\n\r\nUnable to curb Long’s tenacity, Harvey dropped the 28th and 29th holes to fall to the largest deficit he saw so far; 4 down. On the 14th tee (No. 32) it seemed as though Harvey had a small window of opportunity to cut Long’s lead and extend the match.\r\n\r\nWith the reality of the match creeping in, Long had to buckle down and settle his nerves.\r\n\r\n“Walking up to the tee on 14 (the 32nd hole) my heart was racing,” Long said. “But I got over my tee shot and stuck to the process, thinking about where I wanted to hit it on the green. I hit a really solid shot and then over the putt, I was looking at the line and almost forgot about what comes with it if I hole it and Joe [Harvey] misses. It literally just missed.”\r\n\r\nNot quite executing to his abilities, Long left himself a mile to get into tap-in range. With roughly 40-feet separating him from the hole, Long was able to split the par-3 with Harvey to make the match dormie heading into the 33rd hole (No. 15).\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nObviously needing to make something happen, Harvey was able to get on in two and had a look at eagle to win the hole and extend the match to the 16th (No. 34). Missing the eagle putt by inches, Long was able to see the line to match Harvey’s birdie and secure the championship.\r\n\r\n“Goosebumps really,” Long said as he recalled the putt. “As soon as I holed it, it all hit me. I am just so pleased and can’t believe it really. It’s all so surreal.”\r\n\r\nOf course, with every victory, comes a loss on the other side.\r\n\r\n“I was so happy for Joe when he holed that putt,” Harvey said. “But as a golfer, I was gutted that my chance to win had come to an end. I am so tired after a long week, so my emotions are a bit all over the place.”\r\n\r\nDisappointed with the result, Harvey still has yet to hang his head about his performance saying that “If you had said at the beginning of the week that I would be in the final, I don’t think I would have believed you. I am really chuffed with the way it all played out this week.”\r\n\r\nAs for Long, aside from being named the 125th Amateur Champion, maybe the most exciting thing that awaits him is a spot in the 149th Open Championship.\r\n\r\n“It’s going to be incredible,” exclaimed Long. “This is what I have worked hard for since I started playing golf. I really stuck in there and battled… I am going to enjoy the experience of playing in The Open. It’s just going to be huge.”",

    "articleText": "Coast-to-coast, wire-to-wire. However you like to say it, Shelby Braukmuller led the entire 2020 Florida Women’s Mid-Am.\r\n\r\nThe 22-year-old University of South Florida fifth-year senior prodded around Vero Beach Golf Club on Sunday following a first-round tie at 1-under alongside Taylor Morgan.\r\n\r\nKicking off her front nine with two bogeys on Nos. 2 and 5, Braukmuller rallied back to even-par on her day with birdies on Nos. 7 and 8. Out in 36, Braukmuller tripped up on the par-4 13th just as she had in her first round. Unable to shake her double-bogey from Saturday, she once again doubled the 13th to move to 3-over on the day.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nMoving to the 16th and 17th, Braukmuller tapped back into her first round, posting back-to-back birdies to negate the dreaded double. Capping her round off with a bogey on 18, the dropped shot did not matter as Brockmuller accrued a 4-shot lead before she stepped onto the 18th tee.\r\n\r\n“I’m so happy to start this season of golf with a win and am incredibly thankful to have so many people cheer me on through it all,” Brauckmuller told the FSGA.\r\n\r\nWith the win, Braukmuller becomes the youngest women’s mid-am champion in the eight-year history of the event.\r\n\r\nMariana Ocano, Heather Wall, and Tara Fleming all finished in a tie for second, three shots back of Braukmuller at 6-over, 150.",

    "teaser": "The Jayhawk senior was a silent assassin as he chased down the leaders at Buffalo Dunes GC",
    "articleText": "The Kiwi from Kansas comes through at the High Plains Amateur. Beginning the day five shots back of the round one leader, Sion Audrain, Hillier had a simple approach to the final round at Buffalo Dunes Golf Course.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\n“Just take it shot by shot,” Hillier told AmateurGolf.com. “I couldn’t really worry about what the guys behind me were doing.”\r\n\r\nShot by shot is exactly what Hillier did. Missing out on three straight birdie opportunities to begin the day, Hillier finally came through with a 15-foot eagle on the par-5 4th. Staying consistent through the remainder of the front side, Hillier was bogey-less as he made the turn at 2-under.\r\n\r\nTrading a bogey on No. 11 with a bogey on No. 12, Hillier got his second-round score back to 3-under with a birdie on the par-5 14th, a hole he bogeyed the day prior.\r\n\r\nForgetting to scoreboard watch as he came to the final five holes, Hillier stood on the gas pedal as he came into the homestretch.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t have many expectations,” Hillier said. “You just kind of have to focus and post a low number.”\r\n\r\nWith ignorance being bliss, Hillier allowed his game to free up as he played more and more aggressively. Ripping driver on the par-4 16th, he “manned up” and got it on the green to give himself an easy two-putt birdie. \r\n\r\n“Thinking you’re two or three back with a couple to go, knowing you have to make a couple of birdies to even have a chance...to man up and be aggressive, that builds a lot of confidence going into other events when you’re under pressure,” said Hillier.\r\n\r\nNot quite done with his final act, Hillier went on to birdie Nos. 17 and 18 to close out the day with a 6-under 66 and a tournament score of 7-under 137.\r\n\r\n“I walked off the 18th hole and my playing partner goes ‘congratulations’,” recalled Hillier. “I go ‘what’s that?’ and he says ‘I think you won.’ and I said ‘uh I don’t know about that.”\r\n\r\nNot knowing he was three clear of the final couple of groups, Hillier was simply playing almost like it was a casual Sunday afternoon round.\r\n\r\nThe win definitely boosts Hillier’s confidence as the Jayhawk heads into a hopeful senior fall season. The Big 12 has yet to organize a set of guidelines for golf as the SEC announced guidelines and schedules for their member schools last week. \r\n\r\nAs a native of New Zealand, Hillier went home following Kansas’ tournament at Bandon Dunes in March. Staying with his parents for 2-3 months, Hillier could no longer handle the ‘luxuries’ his mom and dad provided so he hopped back over to the U.S. where he bunked with his older brother, and former Jayhawk golfer himself, Charlie in Kansas City, Missouri.\r\n\r\nDespite the uncertainty, Hillier and the Jayhawks are preparing for the fall just as if 2020 were a non-pandemic year.",

With limited food and beverage, use of clubhouse, and member lodging, the event would have been reduced to golf only. \r\n\r\nTherefore the decision has been made to cancel the Stocker Cup for 2020 and plan for a big comeback event in 2021.\"\r\n\r\nThe dual cancellations continued the upheaval to the 2020 golf schedule.

The 16-year-old grabbed the low-am lead following the first round with a 6-under 66.\r\n\r\nStarting slow, Plodkowski caught fire to close out the front side with three straight birdies closing out the front side at 4-under.\r\n\r\nCooling off with a bogey on the par-4 10th and another on the par-3 12, Pllodkowski was able to muster two consecutive birdies on Nos. 13 and 14 to get himself back down to 4-under.

    "articleText": "Holding off a former champion, Torey Edwards claimed the 2020 SCGA Mid-Am Championship on Tuesday. The Long Beach State alum grinded his way to his first win since 2019 at Mission Viejo Country Club.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nPosting rounds of 68 and 71 Monday, Edwards took a one-shot lead into the final round. Tallying five bogeys over 36-holes, Edwards told AmateurGolf.com that he simply did not have his best stuff Tuesday as he matched his bogey mark over the final 18.\r\n\r\n“It was probably a little bit of nerves and just anxious energy,” Edwards said. “I knew kind of early on that it was going to be a little bit of a dog fight. The course was playing tough today. I knew I just had to hang in there today.”\r\n\r\nStaying in the fight, Edwards managed to post an even-par 36 as he made the turn as part of the final group. Aiding him in negating three front-side bogeys was a birdie on No. 4 and a clutch eagle on the par-5 8th which was a huge momentum saver.\r\n\r\n“It gave me a really big boost and I felt like I got everything back on track but I missed short putts for par on nine and ten which brought me right back in the thick of things,” said Edwards.\r\n\r\nAs he meandered his way through the front side, a few groups ahead of him 2017 SCGA mid-am champion Dan Sullivan was on a tear.\r\n\r\nCarding four birdies to just one bogey on the front, Sullivan cut his six-shot deficit in half before continuing his charge with three more birdies on the finishing nine for a 6-under 66 just one shot behind Edwards at 4-under for the tournament.\r\n\r\nAs Sullivan waited in the clubhouse, Edwards found his putting stroke to drill home clutch par saves.\r\n\r\n“Things weren’t going well today,” Edwards said. “I just had to have a little self-talk and remind myself that I was still in it even though I wasn’t playing my best. I couldn’t get frustrated by things not going as well as I had hoped for.”\r\n\r\nCiting a 10-foot par save on No. 13, Edwards gained a sliver of momentum and immediately birdied the par-5 14th and par-4 17th to bring his round back to even-par and a one-shot victory.\r\n\r\nThe win comes just one year after a slipped disk forced Edwards to withdraw from the event which was held at his home course, Virginia Country Club. It also marks his first SCGA win since 2017 when he won the Tournament of Champions and first overall win since he claimed the 2019 Long Beach City Amateur.\r\n\r\n“It’s nice to bounce back and be able to get it the next year at a difficult golf course… I’m just excited to outlast everyone and get it done.”",

    "articleText": "Nabbing a win is always an emotional roller coaster. The ups and downs over the course of 18 holes can wreak havoc on a player’s psyche no matter how big or small their lead is. \r\n\r\nIn his first tournament since February, Jason Anthony had plenty of pressure as he stood on the 18th tee of the NCGA Valley Amateur at Schaffer’s Mill Club. Knowing he needed a birdie on the 605-yard par-5 closing hole, Anthony bombed his driver down the fairway, leaving 260-yards into the green.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nPulling 4-iron, Anthony knew where not to miss; right. After missing right and coming away with a bogey on the par-5 14th, Anthony calmed himself as much as possible but pulled the long-iron a bit to the left and 20-yards longer than he would have liked. Citing adrenaline as to why he crushed his 4-iron pin-high, leaving a difficult 20-yard up-and-down Anthony was able to not only execute his third shot but almost call ‘game’.\r\n\r\nHaving to get over a bunker and stop his ball on a green running away from him into a greenside water hazard all while having the championship on the line, Anthony opted for a play that would have made Phil Mickelson smile had he seen the shot in person; a flop shot.\r\n\r\nFlying it perfectly, Anthony’s ball settled four feet from the hole for a near-gimmie birdie.\r\n\r\n“It was the best chip shot I’ve ever hit,” Anthony told AmateurGolf.com. “I can’t tell you how amazing it felt to get my first win as a dad with my little son there and my wife as well.”\r\n\r\nHe might not have had that moment had it not been for an eagle on the par-5 8th in Monday’s first round. Coming off a double-bogey on the par-3 7th to go 2-over for the tournament, Anthony regrouped.\r\n\r\n“It turned everything around,” he said.\r\n\r\nHitting his second shot to 25-feet, Anthony knocked home the big bird to get himself back to even-par before closing out the first round with a 4-under back-side, a score he would battle to keep on Tuesday.\r\n\r\n“Today [Tuesday] was a struggle,” Anthony said. “It was hard to get any momentum positively. I made two or three really dumb mental errors because I haven’t been playing much because I just had a baby that’s four months old.”\r\n\r\nThanks to Nick Moore, a close friend of Anthony’s, shooting himself out of contention, Moore was able to help keep Anthony calm and in the moment despite neither having their ‘A-game’.\r\n\r\n“Nick’s one of my best friends in the golf community,” said Anthony. “He’s just the most even-keel guy. He’s a great influence when you’re trying to get it done under the gun even though he wasn’t playing well.”\r\n\r\nMoore was tied for second with Anthony heading into the final round but was unable to carry over any momentum as he carded a final round 77 to finish in a tie for 9th at 2-over-par.\r\n\r\nAfter clinching the championship, Anthony was more emotional than he expected to be with his wife Natashia and newborn son Jackson in attendance.\r\n\r\n“I was actually surprisingly very, very emotional,” he said. “I almost teared up a little bit when I made the putt. I just love competing and then to have him there, my wife there and get the job done, it was a cool moment. I wasn’t expecting to feel that way.”\r\n\r\nIn the senior division, Jeff Wilson turned around his opening 1-over 72 with a final round 66 that was capped off with birdies on four of his final six holes. Overnight leader Mark Morgan could not keep pace with Wilson as he could only muster four birdies en route to a 3-under 68, one shot shy of Wilson's pace.\r\n\r\n",

    "articleText": "Three shots back to begin the final round, Rand Mendez of Wilmington, Delaware teed it up alongside leader Peter DeTemple (Lexington Park, MD)  and second-place Vance Welch (Laurel, MD).\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nAfter nine holes of play, Mendez was the only one to make any ground up as he tallied birdies on Nos. 4, 6, and 9 to make the turn at 1-under par for the day and the tournament. Dropping shots on the front side was DeTemple as his front side was dirtied with a lone bogey on the par-4 5th, surrounded by four pars each way on the scorecard.\r\n\r\nWelch began the day at 2-under but also dropped a shot to fall back into a tie with Mendez as the two began to chase down DeTemple as the event came to a close.\r\n\r\nIn a deadlock for much of the back nine, no ground was to be given or had until the par-4 15th when DeTemple slipped up with a bogey. Dropping the shot, DeTemple fell a single shot from where he stood on the 1st tee to 2-under-par. Quickly getting back on the horse, DeTemple grabbed a birdie on the 16th to get back to 3-under as his playing partners were one and two shots back, respectively.\r\n\r\nWith pressure built up, the steam began to seep from the final group’s proverbial teapot.\r\n\r\nOn the par-4 17th, DeTemple stayed stagnant while Mendez tied him with a birdie and Welch essentially fell out of a possible three-way tie as the group made it to the 18th tee.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th, both DeTemple and Mendez parred, in anticipation of a playoff while Welch found the water on his approach shot in an attempt to tie the pair with a birdie of his own. Welch finished the tournament with a triple-bogey, good for a T-2 finish at 144 (2-over).\r\n\r\nOn the first playoff hole, both players found the middle of the fairway. Mendez was first to play and elected for a 9-iron from 128 yards out. Flirting with where Welch’s ball ended up at the end of regulation, Mendez was able to give himself a 21-foot, pin-high birdie opportunity.\r\n\r\nDeTemple answered with a dart just right and 9-feet deep, leaving a much better look at a three for himself.\r\n\r\nComing down to a putting contest, Mendez knocked in his attempt center-cup to put the tournament in the hands of DeTemple. Skirting the cup on the right side, DeTemple’s chance went out the window as the title was now Mendez’.\r\n\r\nAs for the pre-senior and super-senior flights, they definitely lacked the drama that the senior flight gave spectators.\r\n\r\nPre-senior (40-54) Rob Menefee tallied a 4-stroke victory with rounds of 73-69to claim the flight with an even-par 142. In the super-senior division (65+), Douglas Wood was cruising to a three-shot victory until a double-bogey cut his lead to just one. Luckily in golf, that is all you need to win by. He pulled off rounds of 73-72 for a 149, one shot clear of Jim Castagna.",

It did not take long for the tournament to sway into Knecht’s hands, as he made two birdies in the first two holes while Volpenhein bogeyed the same holes for a quick four-shot swing. Knecht would make four birdies the rest of the round and was perfect in greens in regulation through 15 holes. His only mistake of the day was his tee shot on the 16th that went out of bounds which led to a double bogey, but his cushion was large enough where the hole’s impact was negligible. Tom Campbell would finish runner-up after shooting the low round of the day, a 67 (-5), while Volpenhein finished in third place two strokes behind Campbell.\r\n\r\n“I had no idea it had been so long since the last time someone won both the Senior Am and Senior Open in the same year,” Knecht said. “I’m thrilled to be able to pull it off. The ball-striking really helped with that; I struck it very well and I switched putters three weeks ago. It changed me from having some ‘really nice’ scores to ‘really great’ scores and that’s been a big difference in my game these last few weeks.”\r\n\r\nKnecht’s victory also assured him of the year’s low amateur honors. He’s the first amateur to win the championship outright since 2015. Bruce Oldendick is the low professional by virtue of a score of 143 (-1) which finished fourth place in the tournament. For the Super Senior Division, past overall champion of the event Craig RauvolaBouta came out on top by two strokes over Steve Rogers with a winning total of 141 (-3).",

    "teaser": "Needing at least a birdie on the last, one North Carolina senior knocked off the dust for the win",
    "articleText": "Golf comes easier to some than it does for others.\r\n\r\nThat can be said for Raleigh, North Carolina’s Paul Simson. One-shot back of Evan Long to begin the final round, Simson was calm, cool, and collected throughout the day.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nOf course, Simson has been there before. 38 times before, to be exact. Over the years, Simson has etched his name into 38 Carolinas Golf Association trophies. Looking to make it three in a row for No. 39 at Kinston Country Club in Kinston, North Carolina, Simson had some work to do.\r\n\r\n“I started out as hot as a firecracker,” Simson told the CGA. “I was three-under through four holes. I had a two-shot lead and was thinking things were going to be pretty good. Then I didn’t make any more birdies.”\r\n\r\nFollowing a bogey on the par-4 6th, Simson went from a firecracker to an icicle. Following the 6th, Simson carded 11-consecutive pars. Meanwhile, Long had an eventful and colorful scorecard that netted him a 1-under final round, good for a 4-under total through No. 17.\r\n\r\nOne-shot ahead of Long on the 18th tee, Simson knew he had to make something happen as Long was coming off a birdie on No. 17. Striping his driver down the middle of the fairway, he trusted his 3-iron rescue to get him on the green in two for a possible eagle attempt.\r\n\r\nHe delivered.\r\n\r\nKnocking the hybrid to 12-feet, Simson had the advantage. Long, needing three shots to get onto the green, put his approach to just 5-feet for birdie. With the tournament coming down to a putting contest, Simson called game.\r\n\r\n“I took the putter right out of his hands by making that putt for eagle,” said Simson. “That was good because I think he probably would have made it if we had been going down the first hole.”\r\n\r\nWith the eagle, Simson tallied his first under-par score since the fourth hole and broke a streak of 11-straight pars. Finishing at 6-under, Simson looked on as Long tapped in his birdie to get to 4-under par, sealing the victory for Simson.\r\n\r\nIn the 70+ division, Jack Martin (Durham, NC) needed all of his first-round 67 to stay clear of a charging Charlie Parks (Asheboro, NC) who carded a final round 68 to finish one shot back of Martin. Martin posted an even-par 71 to finish at 4-under for the event, taking home the championship.",

Cooling off until the par-4 15th for his seventh birdie on the day, he finally tripped himself up with his lone bogey of the day on the par-4 16th.\r\n\r\nThe 40-year-old Gonzalez comes into the tournament in good form, having won his second straight Sacramento County Championship at nearby Ancil Hoffman Golf Course. After starting his round with 12 straight pars, Gonzalez caught fire with five birdies on the final six holes.\r\n\r\nTilly, a senior at Cal-Berkeley, mixed 8 birdies with 3 bogeys. Watch out for him if he stays hot; earlier this year he won the Grapevine Amateur by 11 shots.\r\n\r\nThree golfers sit just one off the leaders at 4 under. The most popular score under par on Saturday was 3 under as nine players posted 69s. Two-time defending champion Devon Bling could not gain momentum like so many others in the field. Bling begins Sunday 5 shots off the lead after a Saturday 72.\r\n\r\nFollowing the conclusion of Sunday’s round, the cut will be made. At the time of publication, the current cut line is set at 1 over par as there are 61 players at or under par.\r\n\r\nThe second round is set to begin at 7:00 am local time.\r\n\r\n<b>STATE FAIR WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP</b>\r\n\r\nSacramento State sophomore Tess Blair leads the way for the women at Bartley Cavanaugh Golf Course. \r\n\r\nCarding a 7-under 65, Blair got off to a hot start with three birdies on the opening three holes at BCGC. The Big Sky Player of the Year and Freshman of the Year is keeping her game sharp despite the Big Sky Conference postponing all fall competitions to the spring of 2021.\r\n\r\nHolding a 5-shot lead over her nearest competition, Blair just needs to keep the ball in front of her on Sunday to claim the title. \r\n\r\n<b>STATE FAIR SENIOR AND SUPER SENIOR</b>\r\n\r\nAfter 18 holes, Chris Miller and Charles Richesin are in prime position to claim their first California State Fair titles.\r\n\r\n<ACG_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nMiller, holding a two-shot lead over David Bills, posted a bogey-free 65 at Mather Golf Course. Miller cruised through Mather out in 32, in with 33 for a bogey-free start.\r\n\r\nDavid Bills took a methodical approach after starting the day with an even-par front side. Tallying birdies on Nos. 10, 13, 15, 17, and 18, Bills built plenty of momentum towards Sunday’s final round.\r\n\r\nDefending (and three-time) champion Mark Morgan sits in solo third following a 3-under 69. Five players are tied for fourth place at 2 under and three at one under.\r\n\r\nIn the Super Senior division, Charles Richesin commands a three-shot lead over a trio of players at one over par.\r\n\r\nRichesin leads the final group off the No. 1 tee at 9:10 am local time.",

    "teaser": "Two Utah Utes made history while former champion Preston Summerhays opted out of a title defense",
    "articleText": "For the first time since 1981, an active Utah Utes golfer can claim the Utah State Amateur Championship.\r\n\r\nMitchell Schow, a senior for the Utes, battled his teammate Blake Tomlinson for the state amateur title at Jeremy Ranch Golf & Country Club in Park City, Utah.\r\n\r\nWith the Pac-12 either postponing fall sports to the spring or cancelling them for the season outright, the two Utes were able to make a run for the state championship over the past week.\r\n\r\nA unique situation, Schow would not have been as bummed about a loss on Saturday had it been to his teammate.\r\n\r\n“You never want a losing mindset,” Schow told Sean Walker of KSL.com. “But if I were to lose, I’d have been proud of Blake.”\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe match, at times, was almost as loose as a practice round. Tomlinson joked about the experience saying “When we were over our shots, we were absolutely serious and being pretty professional about it. But in between shots, him and I are the type of golfers where we can laugh a bit.”\r\n\r\nTomlinson, who grabbed a 2 up lead through the first four holes of the 36 hole match, lost his first hole of the day on No. 5. Holding a 1 up lead until No. 12, the momentum quickly changed in favour of Schow.\r\n\r\nWinning Nos. 12, 13,14, 15, and 16, Schow went from being 1 down to 4 up as the pair walked to the 17th tee. Taking another win on the 18th, Schow took a 5 up lead into the final 18.\r\n\r\nFamiliar with each other’s games as they have played over 500 rounds together over the course of their careers at the University of Utah, Tomlinson was able to pick and choose his spots to begin chipping away at Schow’s big lead.\r\n\r\nTrimming Schow’s lead to 2 up, Tomlinson won hole Nos. 20 and 21, Schow picked up a win on the 28th hole (No. 10) as the group made its way to the championship nine.\r\n\r\n“It was kind of hard to give each other crap, and be in that competitive mindset everyone wants to be in,” said Schow “But I like to stay loose, and I don’t take anything very serious. So it kind of helped me in that way.”\r\n\r\nSchow had to wait until the 31st hole (No. 13) to pick up a win to go 4 up with just five to play. Not going down quietly, Tomlinson took control of the 32nd hole to stay alive and cut the lead to 3 up. Able to pull out halves on the next two holes, Schow claimed victory on the par 5 16th, 3&2.\r\n\r\nThanks to Preston Summerhays opting out of a title defence to go play in an AJGA event (which he leads by one heading into Sunday’s final round), the two Utes were able to make history in an event dominated by BYU or a Summerhays.",

    "articleText": "The California State Fair completed play on Sunday with three champions crowned and the Men's Championship set up for an exciting final round.\r\n\r\nSix players were tied for the lead heading into Sunday’s second round at Haggin Oaks: Alister MacKenzie Course. The same cannot be said following Sunday’s round. None of the round one leaders matched their Saturday score.\r\n\r\nFollowing a first round 2-under 70, Blake Hathcoat (St. Mary’s) fired an 8-under 64 to take a one-shot lead over three players heading into Monday's final round. Out in 33, Hathcoat played his final nine holes at five under par, capping his round with an eagle three on the 18th.\r\n\r\nJackson Lake shot a 67 to move into a second-place tie at 9 under with first-round co-leaders Finigan Tilly and Brett Viboch.\r\n\r\nAnother 13 players within four shots of Hathcoat. With 18 holes remaining, the field was trimmed to 47 players following a 36 hole cut at two under par.\r\n\r\nPlay resumes at 7:00 am local time with 18 holes to play.\r\n\r\n<b>Women’s Division</b>\r\n\r\nCarding a 7-under 65 on Saturday, Tess Blair was able to separate herself by five strokes as the field went into the final round on Sunday.\r\n\r\nBlair, a sophomore at Sacramento State from South Jordan, Utah, won the Big Sky Player of the Year and Freshman of the Year awards in 2019-20.\r\n\r\nStarting her final round with a bogey, it looked as though Blair might allow the big lead play a factor. But she regained the dropped stroke immediately with a birdie on No. 2, and Blair was steady for much of the day, tallying nine consecutive pars.\r\n\r\nOn the par three 12th, Blair hit a bump in the road with a double bogey. Once again rallying, Blair circled three straight birdies on hole Nos. 14-16. Capping the round off with a bogey on No. 17 and a par on No. 18, Blair got back to seven under for the tournament, finishing off the event with a seven-shot victory and the only player under par.\r\n\r\nC. Sorensen shot the low final round, a 3-under 69, to move into solo second place at even par. Another three players were tied for third at 1 over par.\r\n\r\n<b>Senior Division</b>\r\n\r\nFollowing a first round 65, good for a two-shot lead, Chris Miller left room for error on Sunday. Posting a final-round 71, he went on to claim the State Fair Senior Championship at Mather GC.\r\n\r\nMiller got off to a slow start as he was two over through seven holes. Picking up one of the dropped shots on the par 4 eighth, he got back to red numbers on the day with back-to-back birdies on Nos. 12 and 13 for the second day in a row.\r\n\r\nParring out from No. 14 on, Miller carded a 37/34 split, two clear of his nearest competitor.\r\n\r\nThe defending (and three-time) champion Mark Morgan came up with his second 69 finishing two shots shy in second place. Joey Ferrari finished the event at five under par with rounds of 71-68 in a tie for third with David Bills who was just two shots off of Miller’s pace overnight.\r\n\r\n<b>Super Senior</b>\r\n\r\nCharles Richesin held the super senior lead following Saturday’s first round. Unable to build upon his opening one-under 71, Richesin made room on the leaderboard for a surge from the middle of the pack.\r\n\r\nEmerging from the group of four players who went under par on Sunday was Jeff Burda. Burda rebounded from his Saturday 74 with a four-under 68 to take the win. Tallying six birdies on the day, Burda was three shots better on both nines en route to his comeback victory.\r\n\r\nRon Johnson finished one shot back with rounds of 73-70 for a one under par finish. Richesin was joined by Michael Donnelly in a two-way tie for third.",

To date, 34 past players have graduated to play in the PGA TOUR's THE PLAYERS Championship. Representatives from eight foreign countries and 21 U.S. states (seven from Florida) competed in one of the AJGA’s annual top boys fields at TPC Sawgrass, which featured eight of the top 10 in the Rolex AJGA Rankings.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nThe 2020 Junior PLAYERS Championship field was highlighted by 22 Rolex Junior All-Americans and 49 AJGA champions, including 18 players with 2020 wins. Of the 78 boys competing, 45 players were signed or verbally committed to play college golf. Twenty-five players have previous Junior PLAYERS Championship experience.\r\n\r\nFord started the final round seven strokes off the lead at 1-over-par 145, but quickly got back into red figures with birdies on his first two holes on THE PLAYERS Stadium Course. The University of North Carolina verbal commit added six pars to make the turn bogey-free and 3-under-par 33.\r\n\r\nFord stormed to the top of the leaderboard with birdies on Nos. 10-12. He made his first bogey on the par-4 No. 15, but immediately got it back with a birdie on the par 5 No. 16.\r\n\r\nThe 2019 Rolex Junior All-American made par on Nos. 17 and 18 to post the lowest round of the day at 6-under-par 66. Ford won the tournament at 5-under-par 211.\r\n\r\nThe win was Ford's fourth AJGA victory, and second major win after claiming the AJGA Invitational at Sedgefield in June, hosted on another PGA TOUR course which hosts the Wyndham Championship. Ford has yet to finish outside of the top 10 in four national junior golf tournaments this year. The 2021 grad entered The Junior PLAYERS Championship No. 3 in the Rolex AJGA Rankings.\r\n\r\n\"It’s cool that THE PLAYERS Championship is here and there’s so many who’ve gone from Junior PLAYERS to THE PLAYERS, but I’m really trying to take everything one step at a time,\" said Ford. \"Pro golf I hope is in the future, college golf is soon, but for now it’s junior golf. I’m trying to focus on how I can set records there, and not set limits anywhere else.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Morrison of Dallas; Scotty Kennon of Bradenton, Florida; Kelly Chinn of Great Falls, Virginia, and Karl Vilips of Perth, Australia, finished tied for second at 3-under-par 213.\r\n\r\nMorrison had the second lowest round of the day at 4-under-par 68 and compiled his best career AJGA finish. His round included eagles on the par-5 No. 9 and the par-4 No. 12. The University of Texas at Austin verbal commit entered the week No. 38 in the Rolex AJGA Rankings and won the Southern Junior Championship in August.\r\n\r\nKennon, who is No. 69 in the Rolex AJGA Rankings, went the first 17 holes of the final round at or under par. He ultimately found the water on No. 18 and made bogey to finish at 1-under-par 71. The 2019 Rolex Junior All-American and ACE Grant recipient is verbally committed to Wake Forest, and owns two AJGA victories, including the AJGA Dana Incorporated Junior Open in July.\r\n\r\nChinn had an up-and-down final round that included four birdies and three bogeys for a 1-under-par 71. The Duke University verbal commit came to TPC Sawgrass as No. 1 in the Rolex AJGA Rankings. Chinn, a 2019 Rolex Junior All-American, won the 2019 Rolex Tournament of Champions to open the season and finished sixth at the AJGA Invitational at Sedgefield in June.\r\n\r\nVilips, competing in a record fifth Junior PLAYERS Championship, finished the final round at even-par 72 for his last junior golf tournament before he begins at Stanford later this month. The Australian won seven national junior golf tournaments, including three AJGA Invitationals and was a four-time Rolex Junior All-American.",

    "articleText": "Finigan Tilly of San Carlos, California battled the heatwave that engulfed the West Coast en route to a one shot victory over Brett Viboch and Blake Hathcoat at the 96th California State Fair Amateur.\r\n\r\nTilly, who was one of six co-leaders following Saturday’s first round, posted 67-68-67 for a 202 total. The Cal-Berkley senior sat one shot off the overnight leader, Hathcoat, who posted the low round of the tournament (64) on Sunday.\r\n\r\nHathcoat strengthened his lead on the first five holes of the final round with birdies on hole Nos. 1, 3, 4, and 5 to get to 14 under par for the tournament. Able to keep Hathcoat within arms reach, Tilly nabbed consecutive birdies on Nos. 2 and 3 to get to 11 under.\r\n\r\n<AGC_MOBILEAD>\r\n\r\nGaining another shot as the pair made the turn, Hathcoat held just a one shot advantage. As the two headed to the 14th tee, Tilly took control, getting to 14 under with back-to-back birdies on Nos. 12 and 13 to take the lead.\r\n\r\nUnable to gain any traction, Hathcoat saw his lead slip away as he came back to the clubhouse with 11 consecutive pars to close out the championship.\r\n\r\nAfter a one under par front nine, Brett Viboch made a run at Tilly as Hathcoat treaded water. Alternating birdies and pars over the final eight holes, Viboch came home in three under for a four-under 68, but ultimately finished one shot short along with Hathcoat at 13 under par.\r\n\r\nIn Sunday's second round, Tilly's bogey on the par-3 14th led to four in a row. On Monday, he again bogeyed the 14th but this time he didn't waver, rebounding with two pars and a birdie at the par-5 17th to give himself a one shot cushion heading to the par-5 18th. With Viboch in the clubhouse and Hathcoat unable to birdie the par-5 finisher, a par gave the Cal Golden Bear the championship.\r\n\r\nNicholas Infanti (Clarksburg, Md.) closed with a 67 to finish 12 under, two shots back in fourth. Ethan Farnam (66), Sam Harned (68) and Mason Greene (69) tied for fifth at 11-under 205.\r\n\r\nThe two-time defending champion, Devon Bling of Ridgecrest, Calif. and UCLA, shot a final-round 67 to finish tied for 18th at 7 under par.\r\n\r\nScoring was excellent throughout the three-day weekend, with 41 players finishing the tournament under par for 54 holes.",
